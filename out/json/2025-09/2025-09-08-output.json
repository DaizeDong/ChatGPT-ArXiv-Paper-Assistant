        "abstract": "Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length, and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.   Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM, and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms. SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior. For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4 percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and scalable large model design.",

We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.",

While absolute positional encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.",

This paper establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial regression.

In this work, we investigate \\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and \\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on ''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'', such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks. This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.",

In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.",

Using this approach, we track the evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects (RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining.

However, since the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover, integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector -- placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio, video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e., satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules) with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs 64$\\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality coverage of foundation models.",

ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently model long-range dependencies and global context.

We argue that first-order optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.",

        "title": "HyPINO: Multi-Physics Neural Operators via HyperPINNs and the Method of Manufactured Solutions",
        "abstract": "We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a \"delta\" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case, while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Estimating density ratios is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but existing methods often trade off accuracy for efficiency. We propose \\textit{Interval-annealed Secant Alignment Density Ratio Estimation (ISA-DRE)}, a framework that enables accurate, any-step estimation without numerical integration.   Instead of modeling infinitesimal tangents as in prior methods, ISA-DRE learns a global secant function, defined as the expectation of all tangents over an interval, with provably lower variance, making it more suitable for neural approximation. This is made possible by the \\emph{Secant Alignment Identity}, a self-consistency condition that formally connects the secant with its underlying tangent representations.   To mitigate instability during early training, we introduce \\emph{Contraction Interval Annealing}, a curriculum strategy that gradually expands the alignment interval during training. This process induces a contraction mapping, which improves convergence and training stability.   Empirically, ISA-DRE achieves competitive accuracy with significantly fewer function evaluations compared to prior methods, resulting in much faster inference and making it well suited for real-time and interactive applications.",

        "title": "ParaThinker: Native Parallel Thinking as a New Paradigm to Scale LLM Test-time Compute",
        "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer, sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy itself, a phenomenon we term \"Tunnel Vision\", where a model's imperfect initial steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width) is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5% for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient dimension for scaling future LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model and query features. However, existing works primarily focus on offline scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$ under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of 3.55$\\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\\times$ in cost efficiency, and nearly 4.25$\\times$ in throughput.",

        "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence, improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy.

        "title": "Adapt in the Wild: Test-Time Entropy Minimization with Sharpness and Feature Regularization",
        "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2) the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class. Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.",
