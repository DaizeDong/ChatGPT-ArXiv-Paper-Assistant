        "abstract": "Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.",

        "abstract": "The local structure of a protein strongly impacts its function and interactions with other molecules. Therefore, a concise, informative representation of a local protein environment is essential for modeling and designing proteins and biomolecular interactions. However, these environments' extensive structural and chemical variability makes them challenging to model, and such representations remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel representation for a local protein environment derived from the intermediate features of atomistic foundation models (AFMs). We demonstrate that this embedding effectively captures both local structure (e.g., secondary motifs), and chemical features (e.g., amino-acid identity and protonation state). We further show that the AFM-derived representation space exhibits meaningful structure, enabling the construction of data-driven priors over the distribution of biomolecular environments. Finally, in the context of biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the proposed representations enable a first-of-its-kind physics-informed chemical shift predictor that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of atomistic foundation models and their emergent representations for protein modeling beyond traditional molecular simulations. We believe this will open new lines of work in constructing effective functional representations for protein environments.",

We observe that standard training procedures introduce inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i) analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii) identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector field.

However, existing formulations often define direction heuristically at the column level, lacking a principled geometric foundation. In this paper, we propose MAP, a novel framework that reformulates weight matrices as high-dimensional vectors and decouples their adaptation into direction and magnitude in a rigorous manner. MAP normalizes the pre-trained weights, learns a directional update, and introduces two scalar coefficients to independently scale the magnitude of the base and update vectors. This design enables more interpretable and flexible adaptation, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments show that MAP significantly improves performance when coupling with existing methods, offering a simple yet powerful enhancement to existing PEFT methods. Given the universality and simplicity of MAP, we hope it can serve as a default setting for designing future PEFT methods.",

By linking the topology of symmetry groups to that of the minima, we derive the number of connected components of the minima of linear networks and show that skip connections reduce this number. We then examine when mode connectivity and linear mode connectivity hold or fail, using parameter symmetries which account for a significant part of the minimum. Finally, we provide explicit expressions for connecting curves in the minima induced by symmetry. Using the curvature of these curves, we derive conditions under which linear mode connectivity approximately holds.

YAQA consists of two components: Kronecker-factored sketches of the full layerwise Hessian that can be tractably computed for hundred-billion parameter LLMs, and a quantizer-independent rounding algorithm that uses these sketches and comes with theoretical guarantees.

This perspective offers a new lens on why high LRs prevent training from converging to the loss minima and how different LRs lead to stabilization at different loss levels. We empirically validate the free energy framework on both underparameterized (UP) and overparameterized (OP) models. UP models consistently follow free energy minimization, with temperature increasing monotonically with LR, while for OP models, the temperature effectively drops to zero at low LRs, causing SGD to minimize the loss directly and converge to an optimum. We attribute this mismatch to differences in the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradients near optima, supported by both a toy example and neural network experiments.",

        "abstract": "Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity, however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e., optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models. Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context performance of Titans, achieving +80\\% accuracy in 10M context length of BABILong benchmark.",

We conduct a systematic exploration of pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to dense inference.

However, traditional gating mechanisms that route inputs to the best experts may fundamentally hinder LLMs' scalability, leading to poor generalization and underfitting issues. We identify that the root cause lies in the restricted expressiveness of existing weighted-sum mechanisms, both within and outside the convex cone of LoRA representations. This motivates us to propose RadarGate, a novel geometrically inspired gating method that introduces rotational operations of LoRAs representations to boost the expressiveness and facilitate richer feature interactions among multiple LoRAs for scalable LLMs. Specifically, we first fuse each LoRA representation to other LoRAs using a learnable component and then feed the output to a rotation matrix. This matrix involves learnable parameters that define the relative angular relationship between LoRA representations. Such a simple yet effective mechanism provides an extra degree of freedom, facilitating the learning of cross-LoRA synergies and properly tracking the challenging poor generalization and underfitting issues as the number of LoRA grows. Extensive experiments on 6 public benchmarks across 21 tasks show the effectiveness of our RadarGate for scaling LoRAs. We also provide valuable insights, revealing that the rotations to each pair of representations are contrastive, encouraging closer alignment of semantically similar representations during geometrical transformation while pushing distance ones further apart.

Prior theoretical work exploring the expressive power of transformers has shown that they can efficiently perform multi-step reasoning tasks involving parallelizable computations. However, the learnability of such constructions, particularly the conditions on the data distribution that enable efficient learning via gradient-based optimization, remains an open question. Towards answering this question, in this work we study the learnability of the $k$-fold composition task, which requires computing an interleaved composition of $k$ input permutations and $k$ hidden permutations, and can be expressed by a transformer with $O(\\log k)$ layers. On the negative front, we prove a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that any SQ learner that makes only polynomially-many queries to an SQ oracle for the $k$-fold composition task distribution must have sample size exponential in $k$, thus establishing a statistical-computational gap. On the other hand, we show that this function class can be efficiently learned, with runtime and sample complexity polynomial in $k$, by gradient descent on an $O(\\log k)$-depth transformer via two different curriculum learning strategies: one in which data consists of $k'$-fold composition functions with $k' \\le k$ presented in increasing difficulty, and another in which all such data is presented simultaneously. Our work sheds light on the necessity and sufficiency of having both easy and hard examples in the data distribution for transformers to learn complex compositional tasks.",

Empirically, BAM enables accurate information retrieval at $500\\times$ the training context length, outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and introducing minimal additional parameters.",

        "abstract": "Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets. Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using about 25% less memory.",

        "abstract": "Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs) by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective: rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator, which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points.

However, due to their enormous computational costs, the deployment and application of LLMs are often severely limited. To address this issue, structured pruning is an effective solution to compress the parameters of LLMs. Determining the importance of each sub-module in LLMs and minimizing performance loss are critical issues that need to be carefully addressed in structured pruning. In this paper, we propose an effective and fast structured pruning method named SlimLLM for large language models. For channel and attention head pruning, we evaluate the importance based on the entire channel or head, rather than merely aggregating the importance of individual elements within a sub-module. This approach enables a more holistic consideration of the interdependence among elements within the sub-module. In addition, we design a simple linear regression strategy for the output matrix to quickly recover performance. We also propose layer-based importance ratio to determine the pruning ratio for each layer. Based on the LLaMA benchmark results, our SlimLLM outperforms other methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Traditional GNNs learns node features in a spatial domain unrelated to the topology, which can hardly ensure topological features.

This solution space is spanned by a set of eigenvectors describing the topological structure of graphs. Within this system, for any moment in time, a node features can be decomposed into a superposition of the basis of eigenvectors. This not only enhances the interpretability of message passing but also enables the explicit extraction of fundamental characteristics about the topological structure. Furthermore, by solving this system of hyperbolic partial differential equations, we establish a connection with spectral graph neural networks (spectral GNNs), serving as a message passing enhancement paradigm for spectral GNNs.We further introduce polynomials to approximate arbitrary filter functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the paradigm of hyperbolic PDEs not only exhibits strong flexibility but also significantly enhances the performance of various spectral GNNs across diverse graph tasks.",

In this work, we show that image synthesis is nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction.

Existing methods typically employ dynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However, their reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture global contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent internal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware, dynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical attention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global contextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy. AnchorAttention comprises three key components: (1) \\textbf{Pattern-based Anchor Computation}, leveraging the commonalities present across all inputs to rapidly compute a set of near-maximum scores as the anchor; (2) \\textbf{Difference-aware Stripe Sparsity Identification}, performing difference-aware comparisons with the anchor to quickly obtain discrete coordinates of significant regions in a stripe-like sparsity pattern; (3) \\textbf{Fine-grained Sparse Computation}, replacing the traditional contiguous KV block loading approach with simultaneous discrete KV position loading to maximize sparsity rates while preserving full hardware computational potential. With its finer-grained sparsity strategy, \\textbf{AnchorAttention} achieves higher sparsity rates at the same recall level, significantly reducing computation time.

In this work, we introduce the Oracle Border Basis Algorithm, the first Deep Learning approach that accelerates Border basis computation while maintaining output guarantees. To this end, we design and train a Transformer-based oracle that identifies and eliminates computationally expensive reduction steps, which we find to dominate the algorithm's runtime. By selectively invoking this oracle during critical phases of computation, we achieve substantial speedup factors of up to 3.5x compared to the base algorithm, without compromising the correctness of results. To generate the training data, we develop a sampling method and provide the first sampling theorem for border bases. We construct a tokenization and embedding scheme tailored to monomial-centered algebraic computations, resulting in a compact and expressive input representation, which reduces the number of tokens to encode an $n$-variate polynomial by a factor of $O(n)$.

        "abstract": "One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables. Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages. First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks. Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g. noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples. These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.",

Unlike contrastive approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics from video, with or without background distractors.

This gain is further illustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on 1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the initialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent of std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes.

        "abstract": "Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have become a cornerstone for processing and analyzing graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by phenomena such as over-squashing, where long-range dependencies or interactions are inadequately captured and expressed in the MPNN output. This limitation mirrors the challenges of the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the theoretical receptive field is underutilized in practice. In this work, we show and theoretically explain the limited ERF problem in MPNNs. Furthermore, inspired by recent advances in ERF augmentation for CNNs, we propose an Interleaved Multiscale Message-Passing Neural Networks (IM-MPNN) architecture to address these problems in MPNNs. Our method incorporates a hierarchical coarsening of the graph, enabling message-passing across multiscale representations and facilitating long-range interactions without excessive depth or parameterization. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as the Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), we demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline MPNNs in capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs, motivating the development of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA, which introduces low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. Despite their empirical success, the underlying mechanisms by which PEFT modifies model parameters remain underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic investigation into the structural changes of weight matrices during fully fine-tuning. Through singular value decomposition (SVD), we reveal that fine-tuning predominantly amplifies the top singular values while leaving the remainder largely intact, suggesting that task-specific knowledge is injected into a low-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, we find that the dominant singular vectors are reoriented in task-specific directions, whereas the non-dominant subspace remains stable. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method that leverages learnable rescaling of top singular directions, enabling precise modulation of the most influential components without disrupting the global structure. Our approach achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple tasks, highlighting the efficacy of structurally informed fine-tuning.",

        "abstract": "Foundation models serve as the backbone for numerous specialized models developed through fine-tuning. However, when the underlying pretrained model is updated or retrained (e.g., on larger and more curated datasets), the fine-tuned model becomes obsolete, losing its utility and requiring retraining. This raises the question: is it possible to transfer fine-tuning to a new release of the model? In this work, we investigate how to transfer fine-tuning to a new checkpoint without having to re-train, in a data-free manner. To do so, we draw principles from model re-basin and provide a recipe based on weight permutations to re-base the modifications made to the original base model, often called task vector. In particular, our approach tailors model re-basin for Transformer models, taking into account the challenges of residual connections and multi-head attention layers. Specifically, we propose a two-level method rooted in spectral theory, initially permuting the attention heads and subsequently adjusting parameters within select pairs of heads. Through extensive experiments on visual and textual tasks, we achieve the seamless transfer of fine-tuned knowledge to new pre-trained backbones without relying on a single training step or datapoint.

While existing approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4 win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on harmlessness.",

Among various approaches, graph autoencoders (GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability. Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements, such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders (GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.",

Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark, Sentinel achieves up to 5$\\times$ compression while matching the QA performance of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context compression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant attention, which aims to achieve efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with fewer parameters. As a representative PEFT method, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces low-rank matrices to approximate the incremental tuning parameters and achieves impressive performance over multiple scenarios. After that, plenty of improvements have been proposed for further improvement. However, these methods either focus on single-task scenarios or separately train multiple LoRA modules for multi-task scenarios, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of LoRA in multi-task scenarios. To better adapt to multi-task fine-tuning, in this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for multi-task PEFT. Specifically, instead of using an individual LoRA for each task, we align different ranks of LoRA module with different tasks, which we named low-rank experts. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive rank selector to select the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training low-rank experts, MoRE can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over multiple multi-task benchmarks along with different LLMs to verify model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, MoRE significantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-task scenarios and incurs no additional inference cost. We also release the model and code to facilitate the community.",

In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics consistency.

Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1) trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local superlinear convergence.

However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.",

In this work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO) in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space. As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable, and efficient physics learning.
