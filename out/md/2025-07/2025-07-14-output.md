## 1. [KELPS: A Framework for Verified Multi-Language Autoformalization via Semantic-Syntactic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08665) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08665

**Authors:** Jiyao Zhang, Chengli Zhong, Hui Xu, Qige Li, Yi Zhou

**Abstract:** Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs), a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic. Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3 (81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are available in the supplementary materials.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a framework for autoformalization in multiple languages, which involves foundational research in LLMs and theoretical insights.

## 2. [From Language to Logic: A Bi-Level Framework for Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08501) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08501

**Authors:** Keying Yang, Hao Wang, Kai Yang

**Abstract:** Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages. Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel bi-level framework for structured reasoning, which aligns with foundational research in representation learning and LLM behavior.

## 3. [Compress Any Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08765) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08765

**Authors:** Juntong Fan, Zhiwei Hao, Jianqiang Shen, Shang-Ling Jui, Yi Zhang, Jing-Xiao Liao, Feng-Lei Fan

**Abstract:** Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel compression algorithm for SAM models, which is relevant to model compression through a new hyper-compression method.

## 4. [Greedy Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Learning with Convergence Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08784) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08784

**Authors:** Chuyan Chen, Yutong He, Pengrui Li, Weichen Jia, Kun Yuan

**Abstract:** Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees. GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

**Comment:** The paper focuses on low-rank gradient compression, which is relevant to model compression and efficiency breakthroughs.

## 5. [Low-rank Momentum Factorization for Memory Efficient Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08091) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08091

**Authors:** Pouria Mahdavinia, Mehrdad Mahdavi

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training. This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially, MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD, proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a low-rank momentum factorization method for memory-efficient training, relevant to model compression and efficiency.

## 6. [The Non-Linear Representation Dilemma: Is Causal Abstraction Enough for Mechanistic Interpretability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08802) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08802

**Authors:** Denis Sutter, Julian Minder, Thomas Hofmann, Tiago Pimentel

**Abstract:** The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question: causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information. Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

**Comment:** The paper discusses the limitations of causal abstraction in mechanistic interpretability, which is relevant to representation learning as it explores how information is encoded in neural networks.

## 7. [BlockFFN: Towards End-Side Acceleration-Friendly Mixture-of-Experts with Chunk-Level Activation Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08771) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08771

**Authors:** Chenyang Song, Weilin Zhao, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Yingfa Chen, Yuxuan Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Abstract:** To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs), architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts (MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g., end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques (e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally, we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over 80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

**Comment:** The paper presents a novel MoE architecture, BlockFFN, focusing on activation sparsity and efficient training, which is relevant to model architecture and compression.

## 8. [Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08045) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08045

**Authors:** Junyi Wen, Junyuan Liang, Zicong Hong, Wuhui Chen, Zibin Zheng

**Abstract:** Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.   We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.

**Comment:** The paper discusses efficient state restoration in LLMs using dynamic KV cache compression, which aligns with model compression and efficiency breakthroughs.

## 9. [Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Approximate Leverage Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08143) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08143

**Authors:** Vivek Chari, Benjamin Van Durme

**Abstract:** Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache, which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked (query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining 1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families.

**Comment:** The paper presents Compactor, a KV cache compression strategy, which is relevant to model compression, particularly in LLMs.

## 10. [A document is worth a structured record: Principled inductive bias design for document recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08458) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08458

**Authors:** Benjamin Meyer, Lukas Tuggener, Sascha H\"anzi, Daniel Schmid, Erdal Ayfer, Benjamin F. Grewe, Ahmed Abdulkadir, Thilo Stadelmann

**Abstract:** Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of future document foundation models.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel perspective on document recognition with a base transformer architecture, aligning with model architecture innovations.

## 11. [Ranked Set Sampling-Based Multilayer Perceptron: Improving Generalization via Variance-Based Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08465) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08465

**Authors:** Feijiang Li, Liuya Zhang, Jieting Wang, Tao Yan, Yuhua Qian

**Abstract:** Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model. Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS) method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling (RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method. Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS, respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a new method for improving generalization in MLPs through variance reduction, which relates to representation learning and training dynamics.

## 12. [PanMatch: Unleashing the Potential of Large Vision Models for Unified Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08400) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08400

**Authors:** Yongjian Zhang, Longguang Wang, Kunhong Li, Ye Zhang, Yun Wang, Liang Lin, Yulan Guo

**Abstract:** This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to yield meaningful results.

**Comment:** The paper presents a foundation model for correspondence matching using a unified framework, which involves architectural innovation and representation learning.

## 13. [Vision Foundation Models as Effective Visual Tokenizers for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08441) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08441

**Authors:** Anlin Zheng, Xin Wen, Xuanyang Zhang, Chuofan Ma, Tiancai Wang, Gang Yu, Xiangyu Zhang, Xiaojuan Qi

**Abstract:** Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation -- achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be released publicly to benefit the community.

**Comment:** The paper explores using vision foundation models as visual tokenizers for image generation, which involves representation learning and architectural innovation.

## 14. [Admissibility of Stein Shrinkage for Batch Normalization in the Presence of Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08261) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08261

**Authors:** Sofia Ivolgina, P. Thomas Fletcher, Baba C. Vemuri

**Abstract:** Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks used primarily to achieve stability and regularization during network training. BN involves feature map centering and scaling using sample means and variances, respectively. Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature maps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of Stein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the mean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence of adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian distributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in image classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks. We present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.

**Comment:** The paper applies Stein shrinkage to batch normalization, which is a novel approach to improve training dynamics in neural networks.

**Authors:** Preslav Aleksandrov, Meghdad Kurmanji, Fernando Garcia Redondo, David O'Shea, William Shen, Alex Iacob, Lorenzo Sani, Xinchi Qiu, Nicola Cancedda, Nicholas D. Lane

**Abstract:** We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture, which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2 iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods. AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\% improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on model sizes up to 350M parameters.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel recursive generalization of the Transformer architecture, relevant to model architecture innovations.

## 16. [scE$^2$TM: Toward Interpretable Single-Cell Embedding via Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08355) <a id="link16"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08355

**Authors:** Hegang Chen, Yuyin Lu, Zhiming Dai, Fu Lee Wang, Qing Li, Yanghui Rao

**Abstract:** Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile, interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse. Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic models.

## 17. [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044) <a id="link17"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08044

**Authors:** Debasmit Das, Hyoungwoo Park, Munawar Hayat, Seokeon Choi, Sungrack Yun, Fatih Porikli

**Abstract:** Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method, ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a data-driven weight initialization method for low-rank adapters, which is relevant to model compression and efficiency improvements.

## 18. [Filter Equivariant Functions: A symmetric account of length-general extrapolation on lists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08796) <a id="link18"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08796

**Authors:** Owen Lewis, Neil Ghani, Andrew Dudzik, Christos Perivolaropoulos, Razvan Pascanu, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c

**Abstract:** What should a function that extrapolates beyond known input/output examples look like? This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function matching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct extrapolant. We argue that a "good" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of rules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following in list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when certain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to express such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our paper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant functions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some basic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map equivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter equivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial structures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which constructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it behaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly.

**Comment:** The paper introduces filter equivariant functions, which is a novel concept in representation learning, focusing on extrapolation in list functions.

## 19. [Space filling positionality and the Spiroformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08456) <a id="link19"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.08456

**Authors:** M. Maurin, M. \'A. Evangelista-Alvarado, P. Su\'arez-Serrato

**Abstract:** Transformers excel when dealing with sequential data. Generalizing transformer models to geometric domains, such as manifolds, we encounter the problem of not having a well-defined global order. We propose a solution with attention heads following a space-filling curve. As a first experimental example, we present the Spiroformer, a transformer that follows a polar spiral on the $2$-sphere.

**Comment:** The paper proposes the Spiroformer, a transformer model for geometric domains, which is relevant to model architecture.
