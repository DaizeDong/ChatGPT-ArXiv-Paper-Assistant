        "abstract": "Prior work on in-context copying has shown the existence of induction heads, which attend to and promote individual tokens during copying. In this work we introduce a new type of induction head: concept-level induction heads, which copy entire lexical units instead of individual tokens. Concept induction heads learn to attend to the ends of multi-token words throughout training, working in parallel with token-level induction heads to copy meaningful text. We show that these heads are responsible for semantic tasks like word-level translation, whereas token induction heads are vital for tasks that can only be done verbatim, like copying nonsense tokens. These two \"routes\" operate independently: in fact, we show that ablation of token induction heads causes models to paraphrase where they would otherwise copy verbatim. In light of these findings, we argue that although token induction heads are vital for specific tasks, concept induction heads may be more broadly relevant for in-context learning.",

        "abstract": "Post-training is essential for the success of large language models (LLMs), transforming pre-trained base models into more useful and aligned post-trained models. While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by linear vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training.",

        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are gradually becoming the foundation for many artificial intelligence applications. However, understanding their internal working mechanisms has continued to puzzle researchers, which in turn limits the further enhancement of their capabilities. In this paper, we seek to investigate how multimodal knowledge evolves and eventually induces natural languages in LVLMs. We design a series of novel strategies for analyzing internal knowledge within LVLMs, and delve into the evolution of multimodal knowledge from three levels, including single token probabilities, token probability distributions, and feature encodings. In this process, we identify two key nodes in knowledge evolution: the critical layers and the mutation layers, dividing the evolution process into three stages: rapid evolution, stabilization, and mutation. Our research is the first to reveal the trajectory of knowledge evolution in LVLMs, providing a fresh perspective for understanding their underlying mechanisms.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks requiring complex reasoning. However, the effects of scaling on their reasoning abilities remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic multihop reasoning environment designed to closely replicate the structure and distribution of real-world large-scale knowledge graphs. Our reasoning task involves completing missing edges in the graph, which requires advanced multi-hop reasoning and mimics real-world reasoning scenarios. To evaluate this, we pretrain language models (LMs) from scratch solely on triples from the incomplete graph and assess their ability to infer the missing edges. Interestingly, we observe that overparameterization can impair reasoning performance due to excessive memorization. We investigate different factors that affect this U-shaped loss curve, including graph structure, model size, and training steps. To predict the optimal model size for a specific knowledge graph, we find an empirical scaling that linearly maps the knowledge graph search entropy to the optimal model size. This work provides new insights into the relationship between scaling and reasoning in LLMs, shedding light on possible ways to optimize their performance for reasoning tasks.",

        "abstract": "Foundation models, with a vast number of parameters and pretraining on massive datasets, achieve state-of-the-art performance across various applications. However, efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks with minimal computational overhead remains a challenge. Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) addresses this by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters while preserving pre-trained knowledge. In this paper, we propose SaS, a novel PETL method that effectively mitigates distributional shifts during fine-tuning. SaS integrates (1) a shared module that captures common statistical characteristics across layers using low-rank projections and (2) a layer-specific module that employs hypernetworks to generate tailored parameters for each layer. This dual design ensures an optimal balance between performance and parameter efficiency while introducing less than 0.05% additional parameters, making it significantly more compact than existing methods. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, few-shot settings and domain generalization demonstrate that SaS significantly enhances performance while maintaining superior parameter efficiency compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of capturing both shared and layer-specific information in transfer learning.

We introduce Nemotron-H, a family of 8B and 56B/47B hybrid Mamba-Transformer models designed to reduce inference cost for a given accuracy level. To achieve this goal, we replace the majority of self-attention layers in the common Transformer model architecture with Mamba layers that perform constant computation and require constant memory per generated token. We show that Nemotron-H models offer either better or on-par accuracy compared to other similarly-sized state-of-the-art open-sourced Transformer models (e.g., Qwen-2.5-7B/72B and Llama-3.1-8B/70B), while being up to 3$\\times$ faster at inference. To further increase inference speed and reduce the memory required at inference time, we created Nemotron-H-47B-Base from the 56B model using a new compression via pruning and distillation technique called MiniPuzzle. Nemotron-H-47B-Base achieves similar accuracy to the 56B model, but is 20% faster to infer. In addition, we introduce an FP8-based training recipe and show that it can achieve on par results with BF16-based training. This recipe is used to train the 56B model. All Nemotron-H models will be released, with support in Hugging Face, NeMo, and Megatron-LM.",

        "abstract": "Grokking, referring to the abrupt improvement in test accuracy after extended overfitting, offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of model generalization. Existing researches based on progress measures imply that grokking relies on understanding the optimization dynamics when the loss function is dominated solely by the weight decay term. However, we find that this optimization merely leads to token uniformity, which is not a sufficient condition for grokking. In this work, we investigate the grokking mechanism underlying the Transformer in the task of prime number operations. Based on theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we present the following insights: (i) The weight decay term encourages uniformity across all tokens in the embedding space when it is minimized. (ii) The occurrence of grokking is jointly determined by the uniformity of the embedding space and the distribution of the training dataset. Building on these insights, we provide a unified perspective for understanding various previously proposed progress measures and introduce a novel, concise, and effective progress measure that could trace the changes in test loss more accurately. Finally, to demonstrate the versatility of our theoretical framework, we design a dedicated dataset to validate our theory on ResNet-18, successfully showcasing the occurrence of grokking.",

Leveraging the potential of these existing expert models in real-world applications requires effective methods to select or merge the models best suited for a given task. This paper introduces SPECTR, an approach for dynamically composing expert models at each time step during inference. Notably, our method requires no additional training and enables flexible, token- and layer-wise model combinations. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPECTR improves routing accuracy over alternative training-free methods, increasing task performance across expert domains.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in the coding, reasoning, and tool-using abilities of LLMs have spurred interest in library learning (i.e., online learning through the creation, storage, and retrieval of reusable and composable functions, knowledge, checklists, or lemmas). Such systems often promise improved task performance through the automatic creation of broadly applicable tools, as well as superior computational performance through the caching of reasoning (i.e., the storage of generated tools). However, we find strong reason to be skeptical. We perform a deep dive into one such system, LEGO-Prover, which purports to learn reusable lemmas for mathematical reasoning. We find no evidence of the direct reuse of learned lemmas, and find evidence against the soft reuse of learned lemmas (i.e., reuse by modifying relevant examples). Crucially, we find that LEGO-Prover does not in fact improve over the simple baseline of prompting the model - the improvements in task accuracy vanish once computational cost is accounted for. Our findings suggest that serious misconceptions exist as to the effectiveness of these techniques, that a serious re-examination of the state of LLM-based library learning is required, and that we require much stronger standards for evaluation including behavioural analysis and ensuring that an equal computational budget is used for baselines.",

        "abstract": "Solving (Stampacchia) variational inequalities (SVIs) is a foundational problem at the heart of optimization, with a host of critical applications ranging from engineering to economics. However, this expressivity comes at the cost of computational hardness. As a result, most research has focused on carving out specific subclasses that elude those intractability barriers. A classical property that goes back to the 1960s is the Minty condition, which postulates that the Minty VI (MVI) problem -- the weak dual of the SVI problem -- admits a solution.   In this paper, we establish the first polynomial-time algorithm -- that is, with complexity growing polynomially in the dimension $d$ and $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ -- for solving $\\epsilon$-SVIs for Lipschitz continuous mappings under the Minty condition. Prior approaches either incurred an exponentially worse dependence on $1/\\epsilon$ (and other natural parameters of the problem) or made overly restrictive assumptions -- such as strong monotonicity. To do so, we introduce a new variant of the ellipsoid algorithm wherein separating hyperplanes are obtained after taking a gradient descent step from the center of the ellipsoid. It succeeds even though the set of SVIs can be nonconvex and not fully dimensional. Moreover, when our algorithm is applied to an instance with no MVI solution and fails to identify an SVI solution, it produces a succinct certificate of MVI infeasibility. We also show that deciding whether the Minty condition holds is $\\mathsf{coNP}$-complete.   We provide several extensions and new applications of our main results. Specifically, we obtain the first polynomial-time algorithms for i) solving monotone VIs, ii) globally minimizing a (potentially nonsmooth) quasar-convex function, and iii) computing Nash equilibria in multi-player harmonic games.",

        "abstract": "Importance Sampling (IS) is a widely used variance reduction technique for enhancing the efficiency of Monte Carlo methods, particularly in rare-event simulation and related applications. Despite its power, the performance of IS is often highly sensitive to the choice of the proposal distribution and frequently requires stochastic calibration techniques. While the design and analysis of IS have been extensively studied in estimation settings, applying IS within stochastic optimization introduces a unique challenge: the decision and the IS distribution are mutually dependent, creating a circular optimization structure. This interdependence complicates both the analysis of convergence for decision iterates and the efficiency of the IS scheme. In this paper, we propose an iterative gradient-based algorithm that jointly updates the decision variable and the IS distribution without requiring time-scale separation between the two. Our method achieves the lowest possible asymptotic variance and guarantees global convergence under convexity of the objective and mild assumptions on the IS distribution family. Furthermore, we show that these properties are preserved under linear constraints by incorporating a recent variant of Nesterov's dual averaging method.",

We adopt the standard calibration framework that regulates predictions to be unbiased conditional on their own value, and thus, they can reliably be interpreted at the face value by the agent. Allowing a small calibration error budget, we aim to answer the following question: what is and how to compute the optimal predictor under this calibration error budget, especially when there exists incentive misalignment between the principal and the agent? We focus on standard Lt-norm Expected Calibration Error (ECE) metric.   We develop a general framework by viewing predictors as post-processed versions of perfectly calibrated predictors. Using this framework, we first characterize the structure of the optimal predictor. Specifically, when the principal's utility is event-independent and for L1-norm ECE, we show: (1) the optimal predictor is over-(resp. under-) confident for high (resp. low) true expected outcomes, while remaining perfectly calibrated in the middle; (2) the miscalibrated predictions exhibit a collinearity structure with the principal's utility function. On the algorithmic side, we provide a FPTAS for computing approximately optimal predictor for general principal utility and general Lt-norm ECE. Moreover, for the L1- and L-Infinity-norm ECE, we provide polynomial-time algorithms that compute the exact optimal predictor.",

However, a key challenge is the substantial storage cost: reconstructing a single scene typically requires millions of Gaussian splats, each represented by 59 floating-point parameters, resulting in approximately 1~GB of memory. To address this challenge, we propose a compression method by building separate attribute codebooks and storing only discrete code indices. Specifically, we employ noise-substituted vector quantization technique to jointly train the codebooks and model features, ensuring consistency between gradient descent optimization and parameter discretization. Our method reduces the memory consumption efficiently (around $45\\times$) while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality on standard 3D benchmark scenes. Experiments on different codebook sizes show the trade-off between compression ratio and image quality. Furthermore, the trained compressed model remains fully compatible with popular 3DGS viewers and enables faster rendering speed, making it well-suited for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable self-improvement capabilities, whereby models iteratively revise their outputs through self-generated feedback. While this reflective mechanism has shown promise in enhancing task performance, recent studies suggest that it may also introduce undesirable biases-most notably, self-bias, or the tendency of LLMs to favor their own prior outputs. In this work, we extend this line of inquiry by investigating the impact on confidence estimation. We evaluate three representative self-improvement paradigms-basic prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and tuning-based methods and find that iterative self-improvement can lead to systematic overconfidence, as evidenced by a steadily increasing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and lower accuracy with high confidence. We then further explore the integration of confidence calibration techniques with self-improvement. Specifically, we compare three strategies: (1) applying calibration after multiple rounds of self-improvement, (2) calibrating before self-improvement, and (3) applying calibration iteratively at each self-improvement step. Our results show that iterative calibration is most effective in reducing ECE, yielding improved calibration. Our work pioneers the study of self-improving LLMs from a calibration perspective, offering valuable insights into balancing model performance and reliability.",

Through a comprehensive evaluation across six LLMs and three tasks, we demonstrate that Noiser consistently outperforms existing gradient-based, attention-based, and perturbation-based FA methods in terms of both faithfulness and answerability, making it a robust and effective approach for explaining language model predictions.",
