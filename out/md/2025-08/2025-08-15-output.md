## 1. [A Rose by Any Other Name Would Smell as Sweet: Categorical Homotopy Theory for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10018) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10018

**Authors:** Sridhar Mahadevan

**Abstract:** Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly, introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences" in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past half a century.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs, offering a novel theoretical perspective on language model behavior.

## 2. [XQuant: Breaking the Memory Wall for LLM Inference with KV Cache Rematerialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10395) <a id="link2"></a>

**Abstract:** Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel approach to reduce memory consumption in LLM inference using quantization and rematerialization, relevant to model compression.

## 3. [Memorisation and forgetting in a learning Hopfield neural network: bifurcation mechanisms, attractors and basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10765) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10765

**Authors:** Adam E. Essex (Loughborough University, England), Natalia B. Janson (Loughborough University, England), Rachel A. Norris (Loughborough University, England), Alexander G. Balanov (Loughborough University, England)

**Abstract:** Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features, including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to mitigate their flaws.

**Comment:** The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of memory formation in Hopfield networks, relevant to foundational research in neural network behavior.

## 4. [Beyond Hard Sharing: Efficient Multi-Task Speech-to-Text Modeling with Supervised Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10009) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10009

**Authors:** Hojun Jin, Eunsoo Hong, Ziwon Hyung, Sungjun Lim, Seungjin Lee, Keunseok Cho

**Abstract:** Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert. By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE, achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to both the encoder and decoder.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE) model, which aligns with the model architecture criterion by introducing a novel approach to MoE.

## 5. [Decoupling Understanding from Reasoning via Problem Space Mapping for Small-scale Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10019) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10019

**Authors:** Li Wang, Changhao Zhang, Zengqi Xiu, Kai Lu, Xin Yu, Kui Zhang, Wenjun Wu

**Abstract:** Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization, particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective strategy for strengthening SLMs.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a framework for improving reasoning in small language models by decoupling understanding from reasoning, which aligns with foundational research in representation learning.

## 6. [Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10111

**Authors:** Niels M\"undler, Jasper Dekoninck, Martin Vechev

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars. We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly, our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains practical.

**Comment:** The paper presents a constrained decoding method for diffusion LLMs using context-free grammars, which is relevant to foundational research in LLM behavior and interpretability.

**Abstract:** Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

**Comment:** The paper introduces DINOv3, a self-supervised learning model that enhances visual representation learning, which aligns with the representation learning criterion.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10265

**Authors:** Jingde Cheng

**Abstract:** Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language models (LLMs), led by ChatGPT, many AI experts and more non-professionals are trumpeting the "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of the LLMs. The present author considers that the so-called "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true understanding ability and true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the ability of true correct reasoning.

**Comment:** The paper critiques the reasoning abilities of LLMs, providing theoretical insights into their limitations, aligning with the large language models criterion.

## 9. [Natively Trainable Sparse Attention for Hierarchical Point Cloud Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10758) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10758

**Authors:** Nicolas Lapautre, Maria Marchenko, Carlos Miguel Pati\~no, Xin Zhou

**Abstract:** Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention (NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data, implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

**Comment:** The paper explores sparse attention mechanisms in transformers, which is relevant to model architecture and efficiency improvements.

## 10. [On the Complexity-Faithfulness Trade-off of Gradient-Based Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10490) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10490

**Authors:** Amir Mehrpanah, Matteo Gamba, Kevin Smith, Hossein Azizpour

**Abstract:** ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions, sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods, such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an ``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design choices, datasets, and ablations.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a spectral framework to analyze gradient-based explanations in ReLU networks, which is relevant to foundational research in model interpretability.

## 11. [IBEX: Information-Bottleneck-EXplored Coarse-to-Fine Molecular Generation under Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10775) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10775

**Authors:** Dong Xu, Zhangfan Yang, Jenna Xinyi Yao, Shuangbao Song, Zexuan Zhu, Junkai Ji

**Abstract:** Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design. Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to 64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus 3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation error.

**Comment:** The paper presents IBEX, a method for molecular generation using information bottleneck theory, aligning with AI for Science and representation learning in molecular modeling.

## 12. [PTQAT: A Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Quantization Algorithm for 3D Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10557) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10557

**Authors:** Xinhao Wang, Zhiwei Lin, Zhongyu Xia, Yongtao Wang

**Abstract:** Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks. To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers. Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies, actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy. This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer weights.

**Comment:** The paper presents a novel hybrid quantization algorithm, which is relevant to model compression through quantization.

## 13. [Unpacking the Implicit Norm Dynamics of Sharpness-Aware Minimization in Tensorized Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10435) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10435

**Authors:** Tianxiao Cao, Kyohei Atarashi, Hisashi Kashima

**Abstract:** Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes. Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method, \emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

**Comment:** The paper explores the implicit norm dynamics of Sharpness-Aware Minimization, relevant to representation learning and training dynamics.

## 14. [X-Node: Self-Explanation is All We Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10461) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10461

**Authors:** Prajit Sengupta, Islem Rekik

**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations. Repository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a self-explaining GNN framework, which aligns with the representation learning criterion by providing insights into how GNNs encode information.

## 15. [SABER: Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10026) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10026

**Authors:** Kai Zhao, Yanjun Zhao, Jiaming Song, Shien He, Lusheng Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Tianjiao Li

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable, token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning (LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4% and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH benchmark.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs, focusing on token-budgeted reasoning, which is relevant to foundational research in LLM efficiency.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities, including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of 0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

**Comment:** The paper investigates text dominance in multimodal LLMs and proposes a token compression method, which is relevant to foundational research in LLM behavior.

## 17. [Pruning Long Chain-of-Thought of Large Reasoning Models via Small-Scale Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10164) <a id="link17"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10164

**Authors:** Bin Hong, Jiayu Liu, Zhenya Huang, Kai Zhang, Mengdi Zhang

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation. Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework. Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization (LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a method to reduce the output length of large reasoning models, which relates to model efficiency and compression.

## 18. [RTTC: Reward-Guided Collaborative Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10024) <a id="link18"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10024

**Authors:** J. Pablo Mu\~noz, Jinjie Yuan

**Abstract:** Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary. To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching, which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive, reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable, high-performance language model adaptation.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a framework for adaptive test-time compute in LLMs, which is relevant to foundational research in LLM efficiency and adaptation.

## 19. [Graph Learning via Logic-Based Weisfeiler-Leman Variants and Tabularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10651) <a id="link19"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10651

**Authors:** Reijo Jaakkola, Tomi Janhunen, Antti Kuusisto, Magdalena Ortiz, Matias Selin, Mantas \v{S}imkus

**Abstract:** We present a novel approach for graph classification based on tabularizing graph data via variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and then applying methods for tabular data. We investigate a comprehensive class of Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal logic formulas from graph datasets.

**Comment:** The paper presents a novel approach for graph classification using variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, providing theoretical insights into their expressive power. This aligns with representation learning and model architecture analysis.

## 20. [Pruning and Malicious Injection: A Retraining-Free Backdoor Attack on Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10243) <a id="link20"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10243

**Authors:** Taibiao Zhao, Mingxuan Sun, Hao Wang, Xiaobing Chen, Xiangwei Zhou

**Abstract:** Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer. Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean accuracy.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel backdoor attack on transformers using pruning, which is relevant to model compression and sparsity.

## 21. [xRFM: Accurate, scalable, and interpretable feature learning models for tabular data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10053) <a id="link21"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10053

**Authors:** Daniel Beaglehole, David Holzm\"uller, Adityanarayanan Radhakrishnan, Mikhail Belkin

**Abstract:** Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts of training data.   We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across $200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

**Comment:** The paper presents xRFM, a novel feature learning model for tabular data, which is relevant to representation learning.

## 22. [SynBrain: Enhancing Visual-to-fMRI Synthesis via Probabilistic Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10298) <a id="link22"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10298

**Authors:** Weijian Mai, Jiamin Wu, Yu Zhu, Zhouheng Yao, Dongzhan Zhou, Andrew F. Luo, Qihao Zheng, Wanli Ouyang, Chunfeng Song

**Abstract:** Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will be made publicly available.

**Comment:** The paper introduces SynBrain, a probabilistic representation learning framework for visual-to-fMRI synthesis, aligning with representation learning.

## 23. [Dissecting Generalized Category Discovery: Multiplex Consensus under Self-Deconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10731) <a id="link23"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10731

**Authors:** Luyao Tang, Kunze Huang, Chaoqi Chen, Yuxuan Yuan, Chenxin Li, Xiaotong Tu, Xinghao Ding, Yue Huang

**Abstract:** Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD, which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing, where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

**Comment:** The paper proposes ConGCD, a novel approach to category discovery using representation learning, which aligns with the representation learning criterion.
