## Instruction

Identify any papers that are absolutely and completely irrelevant to the criteria, and you are absolutely sure your friend will not enjoy, formatted as a list of arxiv ids like ["ID1", "ID2", "ID3"..].
Be extremely cautious, and if you are unsure at all, do not add a paper in this list. You will check it in detail later.
Directly respond with the list, do not add ANY extra text before or after the list.
