        "abstract": "Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote\" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of\", which carry the same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly, introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote\" is defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences\" in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past half a century.",

        "abstract": "Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\\sim 7.7\\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.",

        "abstract": "Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as \"black boxes'', as it is unclear how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features, including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to mitigate their flaws.",

        "abstract": "Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., $\\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization, particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective strategy for strengthening SLMs.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars. We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly, our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains practical.",

This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies.

As a result, we present a versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised foundation models.

However, PTQ often leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks. To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers. Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies, actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy. This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer weights.",

In this work, we leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \\emph{Norm Deviation} as a global measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes. Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method, \\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner.

        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a \"text-injection\" mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations. Repository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable, token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning (LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4% and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH benchmark.",

        "title": "When Language Overrules: Revealing Text Dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities, including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of 0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation. Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework. Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization (LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average output length by over 50\\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.",

        "abstract": "Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary. To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching, which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive, reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable, high-performance language model adaptation.",

        "abstract": "Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer. Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean accuracy.",

Very recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts of training data.   We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across $200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs.

        "abstract": "Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will be made publicly available.",

We propose ConGCD, which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing, where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions emerging through multiplex consensus integration.
