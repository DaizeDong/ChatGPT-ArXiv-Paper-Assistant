**Abstract:** We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.   A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

**Comment:** The paper discusses architectural innovations in foundation models, including a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts transformer, which is relevant to model architecture and LLMs.

**Abstract:** Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding) similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

**Comment:** The paper explores sparse feature steering in multilingual transformers, which aligns with representation learning and model architecture insights, particularly in sparse methods and transformer layers.

**Abstract:** Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains, input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework for LLMs, which aligns with foundational research in LLM behavior and interpretability.

**Abstract:** Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and, more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning, biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget. Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

**Comment:** The paper presents a novel SELF-Transformer architecture that iteratively refines attention weights, contributing to model architecture innovation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13540

**Authors:** Yongyi Yang, Hidenori Tanaka, Wei Hu

**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data distributions and settings.

**Comment:** The paper provides a theoretical explanation of in-context learning in LLMs, focusing on representation learning and offering new insights into the mechanisms of ICL.

## 6. [Exploiting Primacy Effect To Improve Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13949) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13949

**Authors:** Bianca Raimondi, Maurizio Gabbrielli

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP applications.

**Comment:** The paper explores the primacy effect in LLMs, providing insights into LLM behavior and interpretability, which is relevant to foundational research in LLMs.

## 7. [On-the-Fly Fine-Tuning of Foundational Neural Network Potentials: A Bayesian Neural Network Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13805) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13805

**Authors:** Tim Rensmeyer, Denis Kramer, Oliver Niggemann

**Abstract:** Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a Bayesian neural network approach for fine-tuning foundational models in molecular modeling, which aligns with foundational research in AI for Science.

## 8. [Minimalist Concept Erasure in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13386) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13386

**Authors:** Yang Zhang, Er Jin, Yanfei Dong, Yixuan Wu, Philip Torr, Ashkan Khakzar, Johannes Stegmaier, Kenji Kawaguchi

**Abstract:** Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work, we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible generative models.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel minimalist concept erasure method in generative models, which involves theoretical insights into model behavior and optimization. This aligns with the emerging trends criterion.

## 9. [SPARQL Query Generation with LLMs: Measuring the Impact of Training Data Memorization and Knowledge Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13859) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13859

**Authors:** Aleksandr Gashkov, Aleksandr Perevalov, Maria Eltsova, Andreas Both

**Abstract:** Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems, generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf. LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM, s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is possible.

**Comment:** The paper discusses the impact of training data memorization and knowledge injection in LLMs, which relates to theoretical insights into LLM behavior.

## 10. [Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) for Imbalanced Data -- An Empirical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14121) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.14121

**Authors:** Pankaj Yadav, Vivek Vijay

**Abstract:** Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However, conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains. Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs. These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning, optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

**Comment:** The paper introduces Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) as a new architectural advancement, which is relevant to model architecture innovations.

## 11. [OmniVec2 -- A Novel Transformer based Network for Large Scale Multimodal and Multitask Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13364) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13364

**Authors:** Siddharth Srivastava, Gaurav Sharma

**Abstract:** We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12 different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining strategy and adapted multitask training.

**Comment:** The paper presents a novel transformer-based architecture for multimodal and multitask learning, which is relevant to model architecture innovations.
