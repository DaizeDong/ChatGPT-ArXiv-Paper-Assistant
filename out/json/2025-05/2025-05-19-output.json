        "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address this, we introduce a new self-correction framework that augments each reasoning step in a CoT with a latent variable indicating its veracity, enabling modeling of all possible truth assignments rather than assuming correctness throughout. To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Search Corrector, a discrete search algorithm over boolean-valued veracity assignments. It efficiently performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior distribution over veracity assignments by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient inference-time correction method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an Amortized Corrector by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. The Amortized Corrector generalizes self-correction, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that Search Corrector reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA) and mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) benchmarks. The Amortized Corrector achieves comparable zero-shot accuracy and improves final answer accuracy by up to 25%.",

        "abstract": "Mixture of experts (MoE) methods are a key component in most large language model architectures, including the recent series of DeepSeek models. Compared to other MoE implementations, DeepSeekMoE stands out because of two unique features: the deployment of a shared expert strategy and of the normalized sigmoid gating mechanism. Despite the prominent role of DeepSeekMoE in the success of the DeepSeek series of models, there have been only a few attempts to justify theoretically the value of the shared expert strategy, while its normalized sigmoid gating has remained unexplored. To bridge this gap, we undertake a comprehensive theoretical study of these two features of DeepSeekMoE from a statistical perspective. We perform a convergence analysis of the expert estimation task to highlight the gains in sample efficiency for both the shared expert strategy and the normalized sigmoid gating, offering useful insights into the design of expert and gating structures. To verify empirically our theoretical findings, we carry out several experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets for (vision) language modeling tasks. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the router behaviors, ranging from router saturation, router change rate, to expert utilization.",

        "abstract": "From a multi-model compression perspective, model merging enables memory-efficient serving of multiple models fine-tuned from the same base, but suffers from degraded performance due to interference among their task-specific parameter adjustments (i.e., deltas). In this paper, we reformulate model merging as a compress-and-retrieve scheme, revealing that the task interference arises from the summation of irrelevant deltas during model retrieval. To address this issue, we use random orthogonal transformations to decorrelate these vectors into self-cancellation. We show that this approach drastically reduces interference, improving performance across both vision and language tasks. Since these transformations are fully defined by random seeds, adding new models requires no extra memory. Further, their data- and model-agnostic nature enables easy addition or removal of models with minimal compute overhead, supporting efficient and flexible multi-model serving.",

        "abstract": "Traditional spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be viewed as a combination of multiple subnetworks with each running for one time step, where the parameters are shared, and the membrane potential serves as the only information link between them. However, the implicit nature of the membrane potential limits its ability to effectively represent temporal information. As a result, each time step cannot fully leverage information from previous time steps, seriously limiting the model's performance. Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the brain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure that functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from earlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later stages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During forward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time steps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and integrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we theoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of vanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms together significantly and consistently improve the model performance on multiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%.",

        "abstract": "Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space. Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process, e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging datasets.",

        "abstract": "The attention mechanism of a transformer has a quadratic complexity, leading to high inference costs and latency for long sequences. However, attention matrices are mostly sparse, which implies that many entries may be omitted from computation for efficient inference. Sparse attention inference methods aim to reduce this computational burden; however, they also come with a troublesome performance degradation. We discover that one reason for this degradation is that the sparse calculation induces a distributional shift in the attention outputs. The distributional shift causes decoding-time queries to fail to align well with the appropriate keys from the prefill stage, leading to a drop in performance. We propose a simple, novel, and effective procedure for correcting this distributional shift, bringing the distribution of sparse attention outputs closer to that of quadratic attention. Our method can be applied on top of any sparse attention method, and results in an average 36%pt performance increase, recovering 88% of quadratic attention accuracy on the 131K RULER benchmark when applied on top of sliding window attention with sink tokens while only adding a small overhead. Our method can maintain approximately 98.5% sparsity over full quadratic attention, making our model 32 times faster than Flash Attention 2 when processing 1M token prefills.",

        "abstract": "Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models sequentially without access to original training data, providing a scalable and efficient solution to continual learning. However, current methods still face critical challenges, notably parameter interference among tasks and limited adaptability to evolving test distributions. The former causes catastrophic forgetting of integrated tasks, while the latter hinders effective adaptation to new tasks. To address these, we propose MINGLE, a novel framework for test-time continual model merging, which leverages test-time adaptation using a small set of unlabeled test samples from the current task to dynamically guide the merging process. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture composed of parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, enabling efficient adaptation and improving robustness to distribution shifts. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations. This suppresses activations on old task inputs and preserves model behavior on past tasks. To further balance stability and adaptability, we design an Adaptive Relaxation Strategy, which dynamically adjusts the constraint strength based on interference signals captured during test-time adaptation. Extensive experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE achieves robust generalization, reduces forgetting significantly, and consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\\% on average across diverse task orders.",

We also show that these networks can exactly represent scalar piecewise affine 1-Lipschitz functions. We then prove a stronger statement: by inserting norm-constrained linear maps between the residual blocks, the same density holds when the hidden width is fixed. Because every layer obeys simple norm constraints, the resulting models can be trained with off-the-shelf optimisers.

We compare neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage: each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation (UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.",

While existing SNN accelerators exploit this sparsity to skip zero computations, they often overlook the unique distribution patterns inherent in binary activations. In this work, we observe that particular patterns exist in spike activations, which we can utilize to reduce the substantial computation of SNN models. Based on these findings, we propose a novel \\textbf{pattern-based hierarchical sparsity} framework, termed \\textbf{\\textit{Phi}}, to optimize computation. \\textit{Phi} introduces a two-level sparsity hierarchy: Level 1 exhibits vector-wise sparsity by representing activations with pre-defined patterns, allowing for offline pre-computation with weights and significantly reducing most runtime computation. Level 2 features element-wise sparsity by complementing the Level 1 matrix, using a highly sparse matrix to further reduce computation while maintaining accuracy. We present an algorithm-hardware co-design approach. Algorithmically, we employ a k-means-based pattern selection method to identify representative patterns and introduce a pattern-aware fine-tuning technique to enhance Level 2 sparsity. Architecturally, we design \\textbf{\\textit{Phi}}, a dedicated hardware architecture that efficiently processes the two levels of \\textit{Phi} sparsity on the fly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\textit{Phi} achieves a $3.45\\times$ speedup and a $4.93\\times$ improvement in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators, showcasing the effectiveness of our framework in optimizing SNN computation.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale Transformer language models (LMs) trained solely on next-token prediction with web-scale data can solve a wide range of tasks after seeing just a few examples. The mechanism behind this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), remains both controversial and poorly understood. Some studies argue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while others contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development in LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel method to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling suite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount of training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks and simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's subspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere \"memorization\" of the training corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent symbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including the influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of mechanistic interpretability. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL and its implications, offering model developers insights into potential improvements and providing AI security practitioners with a basis for more informed guidelines.",

This implies that DNN training via gradient descent implicitly performs kernel learning by optimizing the NTK. In this paper, we propose instead to optimize the NTK explicitly. Rather than minimizing empirical risk, we train the NTK to minimize its generalization error using the recently developed Kernel Alignment Risk Estimator (KARE; Jacot et al. (2020)). Our simulations and real data experiments show that NTKs trained with KARE consistently match or significantly outperform the original DNN and the DNN- induced NTK (the after-kernel). These results suggest that explicitly trained kernels can outperform traditional end-to-end DNN optimization in certain settings, challenging the conventional dominance of DNNs. We argue that explicit training of NTK is a form of over-parametrized feature learning.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, explaining and understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.",

        "abstract": "Binary quantization approaches, which replace weight matrices with binary matrices and substitute costly multiplications with cheaper additions, offer a computationally efficient approach to address the increasing computational and storage requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the severe quantization constraint ($\\pm1$) can lead to significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Double Binary Factorization (DBF), a novel method that factorizes dense weight matrices into products of two binary (sign) matrices, each accompanied by scaling vectors. DBF preserves the efficiency advantages of binary representations while achieving compression rates that are competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in a 1-bit per weight range, DBF is better than existing binarization approaches. In a 2-bit per weight range, DBF is competitive with the best quantization methods like QuIP\\# and QTIP. Unlike most existing compression techniques, which offer limited compression level choices, DBF allows fine-grained control over compression ratios by adjusting the factorization's intermediate dimension. Based on this advantage, we further introduce an algorithm for estimating non-uniform layer-wise compression ratios for DBF, based on previously developed channel pruning criteria.

Can such techniques be used to predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval, and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.",

However, the substantial computational demands of these tasks pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising approach to reduce memory footprint and inference latency by representing weights and activations with lower bit-widths. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of mainstream quantization methods(e.g., AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant) on the most popular open-sourced models (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 series), and reveal that quantization can degrade mathematical reasoning accuracy by up to 69.81%. To better understand this degradation, we develop an automated assignment and judgment pipeline that qualitatively categorizes failures into four error types and quantitatively identifies the most impacted reasoning capabilities. Building on these findings, we employ an automated data-curation pipeline to construct a compact \"Silver Bullet\" datasets. Training a quantized model on as few as 332 carefully selected examples for just 3-5 minutes on a single GPU is enough to restore its reasoning accuracy to match that of the full-precision baseline.",

More precisely, we investigate how prompting induces interpretable changes in hidden states and thus affects the output distributions. We hypothesize that each prompt-induced shift lies in a linear span of some linear representation vectors, naturally separating tokens based on individual concept alignment. Building around this idea, we give a mathematical formulation of self-correction and derive a concentration result for output tokens based on alignment magnitudes. Our experiments on text detoxification with zephyr-7b-sft reveal a substantial gap in the inner products of the prompt-induced shifts and the unembeddings of the top-100 most toxic tokens vs. those of the unembeddings of the bottom-100 least toxic tokens, under toxic instructions. This suggests that self-correction prompts enhance a language model's capability of latent concept recognition. Our analysis offers insights into the underlying mechanism of self-correction by characterizing how prompting works explainably. For reproducibility, our code is available.",

        "abstract": "Transformer-based models with the pretrain-finetune paradigm bring about significant progress, along with the heavy storage and deployment costs of finetuned models on multiple tasks. Delta compression attempts to lower the costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights) through pruning or quantization. However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model as the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may causes significant performance degradation, especially when the compression rate is extremely high. To tackle this issue, we investigate the impact of different base models on the performance of delta compression and find that the pre-trained base model can hardly be optimal. To this end, we propose Dynamic Base Model Shift (DBMS), which dynamically adapts the base model to the target task before performing delta compression. Specifically, we adjust two parameters, which respectively determine the magnitude of the base model shift and the overall scale of delta compression, to boost the compression performance on each task. Through low-cost learning of these two parameters, our DBMS can maintain most of the finetuned model's performance even under an extremely high compression ratio setting, significantly surpassing existing methods. Moreover, our DBMS is orthogonal and can be integrated with a variety of other methods, and it has been evaluated across different types of models including language, vision transformer, and multi-modal models.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic next-token prediction trained using cross-entropy loss is the basis of most large language models. Given a sequence of previous values, next-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the vocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token sequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead, random sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their consistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although consistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a well researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to the best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction converges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent with outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability distribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the entire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all probability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal for a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see that there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval and creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing the correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important and many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous scenarios.",

Finally, we perform multi-task fine-tuning and find that this approach improves the performance on each task individually. Overall, our work demonstrates that a foundation model for tandem mass spectrometry proteomics trained on de novo sequencing learns generalizable representations of spectra, improves performance on downstream tasks where training data is limited, and can ultimately enhance data acquisition and analysis in proteomics experiments.",

Although recent advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$ dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3...$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the embedding spaces blocks our view to design neural operators that can fully capture the target system evolution. Drawing on recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution process in neural operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement our proposed Schr\\\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. In experiments, our $d+1$ dimensional evolving linear block performs far better than others. Also, we test SKNO's SOTA performance on various benchmark tests and also the zero-shot super-resolution task. In addition, we analyse the impact of different lifting and recovering operators on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.",

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising biologically plausible models of computation which utilize a spiking binary activation function similar to that of biological neurons. SNNs are well positioned to process spatiotemporal data, and are advantageous in ultra-low power and real-time processing. Despite a large body of work on conventional artificial neural network accelerators, much less attention has been given to efficient SNN hardware accelerator design. In particular, SNNs exhibit inherent unstructured spatial and temporal firing sparsity, an opportunity yet to be fully explored for great hardware processing efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel systolic-array SNN accelerator architecture, called SpikeX, to take on the challenges and opportunities stemming from unstructured sparsity while taking into account the unique characteristics of spike-based computation. By developing an efficient dataflow targeting expensive multi-bit weight data movements, SpikeX reduces memory access and increases data sharing and hardware utilization for computations spanning across both time and space, thereby significantly improving energy efficiency and inference latency. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of SNN network and hardware co-design, we develop a co-optimization methodology facilitating not only hardware-aware SNN training but also hardware accelerator architecture search, allowing joint network weight parameter optimization and accelerator architectural reconfiguration. This end-to-end network/accelerator co-design approach offers a significant reduction of 15.1x-150.87x in energy-delay-product(EDP) without comprising model accuracy.",

Specifically, SubGCache clusters queries based on subgraph embeddings, constructs a representative subgraph for each cluster, and pre-computes the key-value (KV) cache of the representative subgraph. For each query with its retrieved subgraph within a cluster, it reuses the pre-computed KV cache of the representative subgraph of the cluster without computing the KV tensors again for saving computation.

This paper investigates the capabilities of transformers in solving Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), a fundamental unsupervised learning problem through the lens of statistical estimation. We propose a transformer-based learning framework called TGMM that simultaneously learns to solve multiple GMM tasks using a shared transformer backbone. The learned models are empirically demonstrated to effectively mitigate the limitations of classical methods such as Expectation-Maximization (EM) or spectral algorithms, at the same time exhibit reasonable robustness to distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove that transformers can approximate both the EM algorithm and a core component of spectral methods (cubic tensor power iterations).

In this paper, we propose SepPrune, the first structured pruning framework specifically designed to compress deep speech separation models and reduce their computational cost. SepPrune begins by analyzing the computational structure of a given model to identify layers with the highest computational burden. It then introduces a differentiable masking strategy to enable gradient-driven channel selection. Based on the learned masks, SepPrune prunes redundant channels and fine-tunes the remaining parameters to recover performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this learnable pruning paradigm yields substantial advantages for channel pruning in speech separation models, outperforming existing methods. Notably, a model pruned with SepPrune can recover 85% of the performance of a pre-trained model (trained over hundreds of epochs) with only one epoch of fine-tuning, and achieves convergence 36$\\times$ faster than training from scratch.

        "abstract": "Driven by the relentless growth in model parameters, which renders full fine-tuning prohibitively expensive for large-scale deployment, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for rapidly adapting large models to a wide range of downstream tasks. Among the PEFT family, orthogonal fine-tuning and its variants have demonstrated remarkable performance by preserving hyperspherical energy, which encodes pairwise angular similarity between neurons. However, these methods are inherently memory-inefficient due to the need to store intermediate activations from multiple full-dimensional sparse matrices. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-efficient Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (MOFT) with principal subspace adaptation. Specifically, we first establish a theoretical condition under which orthogonal transformations within a low-rank subspace preserve hyperspherical energy. Based on this insight, we constrain orthogonal fine-tuning to the principal subspace defined by the top-r components obtained through singular value decomposition and impose an additional constraint on the projection matrix to satisfy the preservation condition. To enhance MOFT's flexibility across tasks, we relax strict orthogonality by introducing two learnable scaling vectors. Extensive experiments on 37 diverse tasks and four models across NLP and CV demonstrate that MOFT consistently outperforms key baselines while significantly reducing the memory footprint of orthogonal fine-tuning.",

The conventional practice of retraining LoRA weights from scratch on the latest model is costly, time-consuming, and environmentally detrimental, particularly as the diversity of LLMs and downstream tasks expands. This motivates a critical question: \"How can we efficiently leverage existing LoRA weights to adapt to newer model versions?\" To address this, we propose LoRASuite, a modular approach tailored specifically to various types of LLM updates. First, we compute a transfer matrix utilizing known parameters from both old and new LLMs. Next, we allocate corresponding layers and attention heads based on centered kernel alignment and cosine similarity metrics, respectively. A subsequent small-scale, skillful fine-tuning step ensures numerical stability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that LoRASuite consistently surpasses small-scale vanilla LoRA methods. Notably, on backbone LLMs such as MiniCPM and Qwen, LoRASuite even exceeds the performance of full-scale LoRA retraining, with average improvements of +1.4 and +6.6 points on math tasks, respectively. Additionally, LoRASuite significantly reduces memory consumption by 5.5 GB and computational time by 78.23%.",

        "abstract": "A key factor in effective Self-Supervised learning (SSL) is preventing dimensional collapse, which is where higher-dimensional representation spaces span a lower-dimensional subspace. Therefore, SSL optimization strategies involve guiding a model to produce representations ($R$) with a higher dimensionality. Dimensionality is either optimized through a dimension-contrastive approach that encourages feature decorrelation or through a sample-contrastive method that promotes a uniform spread of sample representations. Both families of SSL algorithms also utilize a projection head that maps $R$ into a lower-dimensional embedding space $Z$. Recent work has characterized the projection head as a filter of irrelevant features from the SSL objective by reducing mutual information, $I(R;Z)$. Therefore, the current literature's view is that a good SSL representation space should have a high $H(R)$ and a low $I(R;Z)$. However, this view of the problem is lacking in terms of an understanding of the underlying training dynamics that influences both terms, as well as how the values of $H(R)$ and $I(R;Z)$ arrived at the end of training reflect the downstream performance of an SSL model. We address both gaps in the literature by demonstrating that increases in $H(R)$ due to feature decorrelation at the start of training lead to a higher $I(R;Z)$, while increases in $H(R)$ due to samples distributing uniformly in a high-dimensional space at the end of training cause $I(R;Z)$ to plateau or decrease. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the best performing SSL models do not have the highest $H(R)$ nor the lowest $I(R;Z)$, but arrive at an optimal intermediate point for both. We develop a method called AdaDim to exploit these observed training dynamics by adaptively weighting between losses based on feature decorrelation and uniform sample spread.",

Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions, essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. We posit that interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge; hence, invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically, as partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations, forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs. On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We formalize the computational foundations for structured representation of the invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic structure.",

Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score consistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and long contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This facilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into long-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference optimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data construction and training processes.

In this work, we derive a theoretical proof establishing the correspondence between IGB and previous MF theories, thereby connecting a network prejudice toward specific classes with the conditions for fast and accurate learning. This connection yields the counter-intuitive conclusion: the initialization that optimizes trainability is necessarily biased, rather than neutral. Furthermore, we extend the MF/IGB framework to multi-node activation functions, offering practical guidelines for designing initialization schemes that ensure stable optimization in architectures employing max- and average-pooling layers.",

In this work, we first derive the MIMO graph convolution through the convolution theorem and approximate it directly in the MIMO case. We find the key MIMO-specific property of the graph convolution to be operating on multiple computational graphs, or equivalently, applying distinct feature transformations for each pair of nodes. As a localized approximation, we introduce localized MIMO graph convolutions (LMGCs), which generalize many linear message-passing neural networks. For almost every choice of edge weights, we prove that LMGCs with a single computational graph are injective on multisets, and the resulting representations are linearly independent when more than one computational graph is used.

Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning. Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2), combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining, simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise ($\\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by 4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from noise-aware pretraining.

In this work, we derive a linear convergence rate for training two-layer linear neural networks with GD for general losses and under relaxed assumptions on the step size, width, and initialization. A key challenge in deriving this result is that classical ingredients for deriving convergence rates for nonconvex problems, such as the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and Descent Lemma, do not hold globally for overparameterized neural networks. Here, we prove that these two conditions hold locally with local constants that depend on the weights. Then, we provide bounds on these local constants, which depend on the initialization of the weights, the current loss, and the global PL and smoothness constants of the non-overparameterized model. Based on these bounds, we derive a linear convergence rate for GD.

By integrating numerical quadrature weights into the attention mechanism, we obtain a geometrically faithful spherical attention that is approximately rotationally equivariant, providing strong inductive biases and leading to better performance than Cartesian approaches. To further enhance both scalability and model performance, we propose neighborhood attention on the sphere, which confines interactions to geodesic neighborhoods. This approach reduces computational complexity and introduces the additional inductive bias for locality, while retaining the symmetry properties of our method. We provide optimized CUDA kernels and memory-efficient implementations to ensure practical applicability. The method is validated on three diverse tasks: simulating shallow water equations on the rotating sphere, spherical image segmentation, and spherical depth estimation. Across all tasks, our spherical Transformers consistently outperform their planar counterparts, highlighting the advantage of geometric priors for learning on spherical domains.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in transformer architectures deeply enhance long-context language modeling. Among them, HyperAttention achieves competitive efficiency by combining a single-level LSH-based clustering with uniform residual sampling. However,such a sampling limits crucial keys' capturing, which in turn raises the overall perplexity. In this paper, we propose a pre-scoring mechanism to assist HyperAttention to prioritize significant keys. Specifically, we introduce three scoring methods: K-means clustering, K-median clustering, and leverage score-based ranking (inspired by LevAttention) to filter keys effectively. We further replace HyperAttention's original uniform residual sampling entirely, relying exclusively on our pre-scoring mechanism. Experiments on ChatGLM2 (131k token context) reduce perplexity from 12 to 8.3, which outperforms standard HyperAttention. Moreover, when running on the Vision-Transformer (ViT), our method shows that it can guarantee similar accuracy compared with LevAttention, and will surpass LevAttention given specific parameters. Although this method introduces computational overhead, its combination with HyperAttention remains 20 times faster than FlashAttention, providing a balanced trade-off between speed and modeling accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating pre-scoring into hierarchical attention mechanisms, significantly improving Transformer's efficiency.",

Notably, different PEFT methods select different subsets, resulting in varying levels of performance. This variation prompts a key question: how to effectively select the most influential subset to train? We formulate the subset selection as a multi-task problem: maximizing the performance and minimizing the number of trainable parameters. We leverage a series of transformations -- including $\\epsilon$-constraint method and second-order Taylor approximation -- to arrive at the classical 0-1 knapsack problem, which we solve through the lens of Pareto optimality.

We introduce Subspace Recomposition in Low-Rank Adaptation (SRLoRA) via importance-based fusion and reinitialization, a novel approach that enhances LoRA's expressiveness without compromising its lightweight structure. SRLoRA assigns importance scores to each LoRA pair (a column of B and the corresponding row of A), and dynamically recomposes the subspace during training. Less important pairs are fused into the frozen backbone, freeing capacity to reinitialize new pairs along unused principal directions derived from the pretrained weight's singular value decomposition. This mechanism enables continual subspace refreshment and richer adaptation over time, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. We evaluate SRLoRA on both language and vision tasks, including the GLUE benchmark and various image classification datasets.

In particular, we study how these choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks, which in turn shape the dynamics of learning.

To identify these biases, methods that interpret high-level, human-understandable concepts are more effective than those relying primarily on low-level features like heatmaps. A major challenge for these concept-based methods is the lack of image annotations indicating potentially bias-inducing concepts, since creating such annotations requires detailed labeling for each dataset and concept, which is highly labor-intensive. We present CUBIC (Concept embeddings for Unsupervised Bias IdentifiCation), a novel method that automatically discovers interpretable concepts that may bias classifier behavior. Unlike existing approaches, CUBIC does not rely on predefined bias candidates or examples of model failures tied to specific biases, as such information is not always available. Instead, it leverages image-text latent space and linear classifier probes to examine how the latent representation of a superclass label$\\unicode{x2014}$shared by all instances in the dataset$\\unicode{x2014}$is influenced by the presence of a given concept. By measuring these shifts against the normal vector to the classifier's decision boundary, CUBIC identifies concepts that significantly influence model predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that CUBIC effectively uncovers previously unknown biases using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without requiring the samples in the dataset where the classifier underperforms or prior knowledge of potential biases.",

Riemannian optimization offers a powerful framework for solving these problems by equipping the constraint set with a Riemannian manifold structure and performing optimization intrinsically on the manifold. This approach typically involves computing a search direction in the tangent space and updating variables via a retraction operation. However, as the size of the variables increases, the computational cost of the retraction can become prohibitively high, limiting the applicability of Riemannian optimization to large-scale problems. To address this challenge and enhance scalability, we propose a novel approach that restricts each update on a random submanifold, thereby significantly reducing the per-iteration complexity. We introduce two sampling strategies for selecting the random submanifolds and theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed methods. We provide convergence results for general nonconvex functions and functions that satisfy Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition as well as for stochastic optimization settings. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to quotient manifolds derived from the orthogonal manifold.

Compared with parameter-dependent metrics (e.g., norm or normalized margin), region count can be better adapted to nonlinear, overparameterized models, because it is determined by the function mapping and is invariant to reparametrization. Empirically, we found that small region counts align with geometrically simple decision boundaries and correlate well with good generalization performance. We also observe that good hyper-parameter choices such as larger learning rates and smaller batch sizes can induce small region counts. We further establish the theoretical connections and explain how larger learning rate can induce small region counts in neural networks.",

In these works, prior knowledge is introduced as an additive bias term of attention weights to guide the learning process, which has been proven essential for model performance. Surprisingly, despite the common usage of attention with bias, its targeted efficiency optimization is still absent, which seriously hinders its wide applications in complex tasks. Diving into the computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in general formalization.

While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive, heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features, type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide representations.

Residual Quantization (RQ) is widely used to generate discrete, multitoken representations for such data by iteratively quantizing residuals in a multilevel codebook. However, its reliance on Euclidean geometry can introduce fundamental mismatches that hinder modeling of hierarchical branching, necessary for faithful representation of hierarchical data. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Residual Quantization (HRQ), which embeds data natively in a hyperbolic manifold and performs residual quantization using hyperbolic operations and distance metrics. By adapting the embedding network, residual computation, and distance metric to hyperbolic geometry, HRQ imparts an inductive bias that aligns naturally with hierarchical branching. We claim that HRQ in comparison to RQ can generate more useful for downstream tasks discrete hierarchical representations for data with latent hierarchies. We evaluate HRQ on two tasks: supervised hierarchy modeling using WordNet hypernym trees, where the model is supervised to learn the latent hierarchy - and hierarchy discovery, where, while latent hierarchy exists in the data, the model is not directly trained or evaluated on a task related to the hierarchy. Across both scenarios, HRQ hierarchical tokens yield better performance on downstream tasks compared to Euclidean RQ with gains of up to $20\\%$ for the hierarchy modeling task. Our results demonstrate that integrating hyperbolic geometry into discrete representation learning substantially enhances the ability to capture latent hierarchies.",

        "abstract": "Modern neural networks often activate all neurons for every input, leading to unnecessary computation and inefficiency. We introduce Matrix-Interpolated Dropout Layer (MID-L), a novel module that dynamically selects and activates only the most informative neurons by interpolating between two transformation paths via a learned, input-dependent gating vector. Unlike conventional dropout or static sparsity methods, MID-L employs a differentiable Top-k masking strategy, enabling per-input adaptive computation while maintaining end-to-end differentiability. MID-L is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing architectures. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, UCI Adult, and IMDB, show that MID-L achieves up to average 55\\% reduction in active neurons, 1.7$\\times$ FLOPs savings, and maintains or exceeds baseline accuracy. We further validate the informativeness and selectivity of the learned neurons via Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) and observe improved robustness under overfitting and noisy data conditions. Additionally, MID-L demonstrates favorable inference latency and memory usage profiles, making it suitable for both research exploration and deployment on compute-constrained systems. These results position MID-L as a general-purpose, plug-and-play dynamic computation layer, bridging the gap between dropout regularization and efficient inference.",

Traditional world models based on deep learning demand vast amounts of training data, and do not flexibly update their knowledge from sparse observations. Recent advances in program synthesis using Large Language Models (LLMs) give an alternate approach which learns world models represented as source code, supporting strong generalization from little data. To date, application of program-structured world models remains limited to natural language and grid-world domains. We introduce a novel program synthesis method for effectively modeling complex, non-gridworld domains by representing a world model as an exponentially-weighted product of programmatic experts (PoE-World) synthesized by LLMs. We show that this approach can learn complex, stochastic world models from just a few observations. We evaluate the learned world models by embedding them in a model-based planning agent, demonstrating efficient performance and generalization to unseen levels on Atari's Pong and Montezuma's Revenge.

        "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective technique for reducing memory overhead in fine-tuning large language models. However, it often suffers from sub-optimal performance compared with full fine-tuning since the update is constrained in the low-rank space. Recent variants such as LoRA-Pro attempt to mitigate this by adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices to approximate the full gradient. However, LoRA-Pro's solution is not unique, and different solutions can lead to significantly varying performance in ablation studies. Besides, to incorporate momentum or adaptive optimization design, approaches like LoRA-Pro must first compute the equivalent gradient, causing a higher memory cost close to full fine-tuning. A key challenge remains in integrating momentum properly into the low-rank space with lower memory cost. In this work, we propose AltLoRA, an alternating projection method that avoids the difficulties in gradient approximation brought by the joint update design, meanwhile integrating momentum without higher memory complexity. Our theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and further shows that AltLoRA enables stable feature learning and robustness to transformation invariance. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that AltLoRA outperforms LoRA and its variants, narrowing the gap toward full fine-tuning while preserving superior memory efficiency.",

We propose a principled approach for uncovering steering vectors by aligning latent representations elicited through behavioral methods (specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo with LLMs) with their neural counterparts.

We further prove that BISR achieves asymptotically optimal error by matching the upper and lower bounds.

While existing theoretical works demonstrate that CoTs with discrete tokens boost the capability of LLMs, recent work on continuous CoTs lacks a theoretical understanding of why it outperforms discrete counterparts in various reasoning tasks such as directed graph reachability, a fundamental graph reasoning problem that includes many practical domain applications as special cases. In this paper, we prove that a two-layer transformer with $D$ steps of continuous CoTs can solve the directed graph reachability problem, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph, while the best known result of constant-depth transformers with discrete CoTs requires $O(n^2)$ decoding steps where $n$ is the number of vertices ($D<n$). In our construction, each continuous thought vector is a superposition state that encodes multiple search frontiers simultaneously (i.e., parallel breadth-first search (BFS)), while discrete CoTs must choose a single path sampled from the superposition state, which leads to sequential search that requires many more steps and may be trapped into local solutions. We also performed extensive experiments to verify that our theoretical construction aligns well with the empirical solution obtained via training dynamics. Notably, encoding of multiple search frontiers as a superposition state automatically emerges in training continuous CoTs, without explicit supervision to guide the model to explore multiple paths simultaneously.",

MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance, forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training pipelines.

        "abstract": "Benign overfitting is a phenomenon in machine learning where a model perfectly fits (interpolates) the training data, including noisy examples, yet still generalizes well to unseen data. Understanding this phenomenon has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we introduce a conceptual shift, by focusing on almost benign overfitting, where models simultaneously achieve both arbitrarily small training and test errors. This behavior is characteristic of neural networks, which often achieve low (but non-zero) training error while still generalizing well. We hypothesize that this almost benign overfitting can emerge even in classical regimes, by analyzing how the interaction between sample size and model complexity enables larger models to achieve both good training fit but still approach Bayes-optimal generalization. We substantiate this hypothesis with theoretical evidence from two case studies: (i) kernel ridge regression, and (ii) least-squares regression using a two-layer fully connected ReLU neural network trained via gradient flow. In both cases, we overcome the strong assumptions often required in prior work on benign overfitting. Our results on neural networks also provide the first generalization result in this setting that does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying regression function or noise, beyond boundedness. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique based on decomposing the excess risk into estimation and approximation errors, interpreting gradient flow as an implicit regularizer, that helps avoid uniform convergence traps. This analysis idea could be of independent interest.",

We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.",

While the recent method known as HiPPO has demonstrated strong performance, and formed the basis for machine learning models S4 and Mamba, it remains limited by its reliance on closed-form solutions for a few specific, well-behaved bases. The SaFARi framework generalized this approach, enabling the construction of SSMs from arbitrary frames, including non-orthogonal and redundant ones, thus allowing an infinite diversity of possible \"species\" within the SSM family. In this paper, we introduce WaLRUS (Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs), a new implementation of SaFARi built from Daubechies wavelets.",

Recent approaches for combinatorial action spaces impose factorized or sequential structures over sub-actions, failing to capture complex joint behavior. We introduce the Sub-Action Interaction Network using Transformers (SAINT), a novel policy architecture that represents multi-component actions as unordered sets and models their dependencies via self-attention conditioned on the global state. SAINT is permutation-invariant, sample-efficient, and compatible with standard policy optimization algorithms. In 15 distinct combinatorial environments across three task domains, including environments with nearly 17 million joint actions, SAINT consistently outperforms strong baselines.",

        "abstract": "Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) leverage rich visual token representations to achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, these tokens also introduce significant computational overhead during inference. Existing training-free token pruning methods typically adopt a single-stage strategy, focusing either on visual self-attention or visual-textual cross-attention. However, such localized perspectives often overlook the broader information flow across the model, leading to substantial performance degradation, especially under high pruning ratios. In this work, we propose STAR (Stage-wise Attention-guided token Reduction), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that approaches token pruning from a global perspective. Instead of pruning at a single point, STAR performs attention-guided reduction in two complementary stages: an early-stage pruning based on visual self-attention to remove redundant low-level features, and a later-stage pruning guided by cross-modal attention to discard task-irrelevant tokens. This holistic approach allows STAR to significantly reduce computational cost while better preserving task-critical information. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLM architectures and benchmarks show that STAR achieves strong acceleration while maintaining comparable, and in some cases even improved performance.",

Our analysis reveals that, enabled by temperature optimization, multi-modal contrastive learning not only maximizes mutual information between modalities but also adapts to intrinsic dimensions of data, which can be much lower than user-specified dimensions for representation vectors. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of contrastive learning to learn low-dimensional and informative representations, bridging theoretical insights and practical performance.",

We introduce a family of premetrics that capture different degrees of structural similarity between graphs and relate these similarities to generalization, and consequently, the performance of expressive GNNs. By considering a setting where graph labels are correlated with structural features, we derive generalization bounds that depend on the distance between training and test graphs, model complexity, and training set size. These bounds reveal that more expressive GNNs may generalize worse unless their increased complexity is balanced by a sufficiently large training set or reduced distance between training and test graphs. Our findings relate expressivity and generalization, offering theoretical insights supported by empirical results.",

Do identical tasks elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through \\textit{function vectors} (FVs), recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task representations. We generalize FVs to alternative task presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different task promptings forms do not induce a common task representation through FVs but elicit different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support to the practice of combining instructions and task demonstrations, imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Counterfactual reasoning has emerged as a crucial technique for generalizing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By generating and analyzing counterfactual scenarios, researchers can assess the adaptability and reliability of model decision-making. Although prior work has shown that LLMs often struggle with counterfactual reasoning, it remains unclear which factors most significantly impede their performance across different tasks and modalities. In this paper, we propose a decompositional strategy that breaks down the counterfactual generation from causality construction to the reasoning over counterfactual interventions. To support decompositional analysis, we investigate 11 datasets spanning diverse tasks, including natural language understanding, mathematics, programming, and vision-language tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we characterize LLM behavior across each decompositional stage and identify how modality type and intermediate reasoning influence performance. By establishing a structured framework for analyzing counterfactual reasoning, this work contributes to the development of more reliable LLM-based reasoning systems and informs future elicitation strategies.",
