## 1. [Ban&Pick: Achieving Free Performance Gains and Inference Speedup via Smarter Routing in MoE-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06346) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06346

**Authors:** Yuanteng Chen, Peisong Wang, Yuantian Shao, Jian Cheng

**Abstract:** Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training, plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from 65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the vLLM.

## 2. [Learning words in groups: fusion algebras, tensor ranks and grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06931) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06931

**Authors:** Maor Shutman, Oren Louidor, Ran Tessler

**Abstract:** In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient descent.

## 3. [Universality of physical neural networks with multivariate nonlinearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05420) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.05420

**Authors:** Benjamin Savinson, David J. Norris, Siddhartha Mishra, Samuel Lanthaler

**Abstract:** The enormous energy demand of artificial intelligence is driving the development of alternative hardware for deep learning. Physical neural networks try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently. In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints, detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying further efforts in their development.

**Comment:** Model Architecture and Representation Learning: proves universality conditions for physical neural networks and proposes a scalable optical architecture.

## 4. [LoaQ: Layer-wise Output Approximation Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06297) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06297

**Authors:** Li Lin, Xiaojun Wan

**Abstract:** A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ, but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution, making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

**Comment:** Model Compression and Efficiency: a layer-wise PTQ method targeting output-level consistency with a simple closed-form solution, improving quantization quality.

## 5. [Evaluating the Efficiency of Latent Spaces via the Coupling-Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06314) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06314

**Authors:** Mehmet Can Yavuz, Berrin Yanikoglu

**Abstract:** A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact, interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality. We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C) can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

**Comment:** Representation Learning: proposes a redundancy index rho(C) using coupling-matrix off-diagonal statistics (energy distance) to quantify inter-dimensional dependencies in latent spaces.

## 6. [From Noise to Narrative: Tracing the Origins of Hallucinations in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06938) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06938

**Authors:** Praneet Suresh, Jack Stanley, Sonia Joseph, Luca Scimeca, Danilo Bzdok

**Abstract:** As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science, business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

**Comment:** Representation Learning: uses sparse autoencoders to analyze transformer internal concept activations and link them to hallucination behavior under input uncertainty.

## 7. [Robust and Adaptive Spectral Method for Representation Multi-Task Learning with Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06575) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06575

**Authors:** Yian Huang, Yang Feng, Zhiliang Ying

**Abstract:** Representation-based multi-task learning (MTL) improves efficiency by learning a shared structure across tasks, but its practical application is often hindered by contamination, outliers, or adversarial tasks. Most existing methods and theories assume a clean or near-clean setting, failing when contamination is significant. This paper tackles representation MTL with an unknown and potentially large contamination proportion, while also allowing for heterogeneity among inlier tasks. We introduce a Robust and Adaptive Spectral method (RAS) that can distill the shared inlier representation effectively and efficiently, while requiring no prior knowledge of the contamination level or the true representation dimension. Theoretically, we provide non-asymptotic error bounds for both the learned representation and the per-task parameters. These bounds adapt to inlier task similarity and outlier structure, and guarantee that RAS performs at least as well as single-task learning, thus preventing negative transfer. We also extend our framework to transfer learning with corresponding theoretical guarantees for the target task. Extensive experiments confirm our theory, showcasing the robustness and adaptivity of RAS, and its superior performance in regimes with up to 80\% task contamination.

**Comment:** Representation Learning: robust, adaptive spectral method to extract shared representations in contaminated multi-task settings with non-asymptotic guarantees.

## 8. [Barycentric Neural Networks and Length-Weighted Persistent Entropy Loss: A Green Geometric and Topological Framework for Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06694) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06694

**Authors:** Victor Toscano-Duran, Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz, Miguel A. Guti\'errez-Naranjo

**Abstract:** While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are \emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains, many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$), is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their \emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters. We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of \emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly \emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and log-cosh.

**Comment:** Model Architecture: introduces a small, shallow Barycentric Neural Network that exactly represents CPLFs and optimizes base points; also proposes a topological loss (length-weighted persistent entropy).

## 9. [TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing with Global Parent-Child Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05550) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.05550

**Authors:** Zixi Li

**Abstract:** We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures through iterative message passing.   The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism, formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.   Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\% accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%), large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component, with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal performance.

**Comment:** Model Architecture: introduces a hybrid Transformer + TreeFFN with global parent–child aggregation for AST processing (conditional/dynamic structure-aware network).

## 10. [HAVE: Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06596) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06596

**Authors:** Xin Tong, Zhi Lin, Jingya Wang, Bo Jin

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together, these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass, making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world settings.

## 11. [FAVAE-Effective Frequency Aware Latent Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.05441

**Authors:** Tejaswini Medi, Hsien-Yi Wang, Arianna Rampini, Margret Keuper

**Abstract:** Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

**Comment:** Model Architecture and Representation Learning: frequency-aware VAE tokenizer with wavelet-based decoupling of low/high frequencies to improve latent representations and high-frequency reconstruction.

## 12. [Learning from one graph: transductive learning guarantees via the geometry of small random worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06894) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06894

**Authors:** Nils Detering, Luca Galimberti, Anastasis Kratsios, Giulia Livieri, A. Martina Neuman

**Abstract:** Since their introduction by Kipf and Welling in $2017$, a primary use of graph convolutional networks is transductive node classification, where missing labels are inferred within a single observed graph and its feature matrix. Despite the widespread use of the network model, the statistical foundations of transductive learning remain limited, as standard inference frameworks typically rely on multiple independent samples rather than a single graph. In this work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure tools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via low-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using a random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic graphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results. The first concerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses random graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \in \mathcal{O}((\log (k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the second. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network setting, where additional challenges arise. Lastly, our learning guarantees remain informative even with a few labelled nodes $N$ and achieve the optimal nonparametric rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ as $N$ grows.

## 13. [MOSAIC: Minimax-Optimal Sparsity-Adaptive Inference for Change Points in Dynamic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06303) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06303

**Authors:** Yingying Fan, Jingyuan Liu, Jinchi Lv, Ao Sun

**Abstract:** We propose a new inference framework, named MOSAIC, for change-point detection in dynamic networks with the simultaneous low-rank and sparse-change structure. We establish the minimax rate of detection boundary, which relies on the sparsity of changes. We then develop an eigen-decomposition-based test with screened signals that approaches the minimax rate in theory, with only a minor logarithmic loss. For practical implementation of MOSAIC, we adjust the theoretical test by a novel residual-based technique, resulting in a pivotal statistic that converges to a standard normal distribution via the martingale central limit theorem under the null hypothesis and achieves full power under the alternative hypothesis. We also analyze the minimax rate of testing boundary for dynamic networks without the low-rank structure, which almost aligns with the results in high-dimensional mean-vector change-point inference. We showcase the effectiveness of MOSAIC and verify our theoretical results with several simulation examples and a real data application.

## 14. [Dato: A Task-Based Programming Model for Dataflow Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06794) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06794

**Authors:** Shihan Fang, Hongzheng Chen, Niansong Zhang, Jiajie Li, Han Meng, Adrian Liu, Zhiru Zhang

**Abstract:** Recent deep learning workloads increasingly push computational demand beyond what current memory systems can sustain, with many kernels stalling on data movement rather than computation. While modern dataflow accelerators incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations, existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively. Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded, task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a physical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on both AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves high performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized code. On the NPU, Dato attains up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM and delivers a 2.81x speedup on attention kernels compared to a state-of-the-art commercial framework. On the FPGA, Dato surpasses leading frameworks in performance when generating custom systolic arrays, achieving 98% of the theoretical peak performance.

**Abstract:** Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts, making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs for downstream generation tasks.

## 16. [An Improved Template for Approximate Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06162) <a id="link16"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06162

**Authors:** M. Rezaalipour, F. Costa, M. Biasion, R. Otoni, G. A. Constantinides, L. Pozzi

**Abstract:** Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks - i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area. We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.05614

**Authors:** Hanzhen Wang, Jiaming Xu, Jiayi Pan, Yongkang Zhou, Guohao Dai

**Abstract:** Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local (current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level: prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed), adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs. OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06600

**Authors:** Huayi Tang, Yong Liu

**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

**Authors:** Filippo Guerranti, Fabrizio Forte, Simon Geisler, Stephan G\"unnemann

**Abstract:** Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06261

**Authors:** Kyungmin Bin, Seungbeom Choi, Jimyoung Son, Jieun Choi, Daseul Bae, Daehyeon Baek, Kihyo Moon, Minsung Jang, Hyojung Lee

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models (LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However, quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation, and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.05801

**Authors:** Debdeep Sanyal, Aaryan Nagpal, Dhruv Kumar, Murari Mandal, Saurabh Deshpande

**Abstract:** While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period) during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts: injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks. Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically grounded representations are a robust property of large time series transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for strategic stress-testing.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06461

**Authors:** Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Baolong Bi, Xuanshan Zhou, Jiayu Yao, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance, achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with contrasting attention.

## 23. [Rethinking Reasoning Quality in Large Language Models through Enhanced Chain-of-Thought via RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06024) <a id="link23"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06024

**Authors:** Haoyang He, Zihua Rong, Kun Ji, Chenyang Li, Qing Huang, Chong Xia, Lan Yang, Honggang Zhang

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer. Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06174

**Authors:** Wei Han, Geng Zhan, Sicheng Yu, Chenyu Wang, Bryan Hooi

**Abstract:** O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery, we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints, allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency, producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user experience.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06701

**Authors:** Su Hyeong Lee, Risi Kondor, Richard Ngo

**Abstract:** We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications for alignment in agentic AI systems.

## 26. [H$_{2}$OT: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Video Pose Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06956) <a id="link26"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06956

**Authors:** Wenhao Li, Mengyuan Liu, Hong Liu, Pichao Wang, Shijian Lu, Nicu Sebe

**Abstract:** Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module (TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06322

**Authors:** Jiajun Bao, Nicolas Boull\'e, Toni J. B. Liu, Rapha\"el Sarfati, Christopher J. Earls

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning (ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting. Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically grounded predictions.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06871

**Authors:** Dounan Du, Eden Figueroa

**Abstract:** Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and external control is an important challenge in quantum information science. Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design, real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across diverse light-matter platforms.

## 29. [Icon$^{2}$: Aligning Large Language Models Using Self-Synthetic Preference Data via Inherent Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05605) <a id="link29"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.05605

**Authors:** Qiyuan Chen, Hongsen Huang, Qian Shao, Jiahe Chen, Jintai Chen, Hongxia Xu, Renjie Hua, Ren Chuan, Jian Wu

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency. Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by up to 48.1%.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.03652

**Authors:** E. Khalafyan, A. E. Allahverdyan, A. Hovhannisyan

**Abstract:** Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

**Comment:** Representation Learning: connects NMF with the principle of the common cause, including robust effective rank estimation and noise-stable features.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.06505

**Authors:** Yu-Jui Huang, Hsin-Hua Shen, Yu-Chih Huang, Wan-Yi Lin, Shih-Chun Lin

**Abstract:** The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian. To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original (unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve the same performance while requiring less computational resources.
