## 1. [Extendable Long-Horizon Planning via Hierarchical Multiscale Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20102) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20102

**Authors:** Chang Chen, Hany Hamed, Doojin Baek, Taegu Kang, Yoshua Bengio, Sungjin Ahn

**Abstract:** This paper tackles a novel problem, extendable long-horizon planning-enabling agents to plan trajectories longer than those in training data without compounding errors. To tackle this, we propose the Hierarchical Multiscale Diffuser (HM-Diffuser) and Progressive Trajectory Extension (PTE), an augmentation method that iteratively generates longer trajectories by stitching shorter ones. HM-Diffuser trains on these extended trajectories using a hierarchical structure, efficiently handling tasks across multiple temporal scales. Additionally, we introduce Adaptive Plan Pondering and the Recursive HM-Diffuser, which consolidate hierarchical layers into a single model to process temporal scales recursively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, advancing diffusion-based planners for scalable long-horizon planning.

## 2. [Assessing SAM for Tree Crown Instance Segmentation from Drone Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20199) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20199

**Authors:** M\'elisande Teng, Arthur Ouaknine, Etienne Lalibert\'e, Yoshua Bengio, David Rolnick, Hugo Larochelle

**Abstract:** The potential of tree planting as a natural climate solution is often undermined by inadequate monitoring of tree planting projects. Current monitoring methods involve measuring trees by hand for each species, requiring extensive cost, time, and labour. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping and characterizing trees from aerial imagery, and large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), may be a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare SAM methods for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery of young tree plantations. We explore the potential of SAM for this task, and find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts, but that there is potential for methods which tune SAM further. We also show that predictions can be improved by adding Digital Surface Model (DSM) information as an input.

## 3. [A scalable gene network model of regulatory dynamics in single cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20027) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20027

**Authors:** Paul Bertin, Joseph D. Viviano, Alejandro Tejada-Lapuerta, Weixu Wang, Stefan Bauer, Fabian J. Theis, Yoshua Bengio

**Abstract:** Single-cell data provide high-dimensional measurements of the transcriptional states of cells, but extracting insights into the regulatory functions of genes, particularly identifying transcriptional mechanisms affected by biological perturbations, remains a challenge. Many perturbations induce compensatory cellular responses, making it difficult to distinguish direct from indirect effects on gene regulation. Modeling how gene regulatory functions shape the temporal dynamics of these responses is key to improving our understanding of biological perturbations. Dynamical models based on differential equations offer a principled way to capture transcriptional dynamics, but their application to single-cell data has been hindered by computational constraints, stochasticity, sparsity, and noise. Existing methods either rely on low-dimensional representations or make strong simplifying assumptions, limiting their ability to model transcriptional dynamics at scale. We introduce a Functional and Learnable model of Cell dynamicS, FLeCS, that incorporates gene network structure into coupled differential equations to model gene regulatory functions. Given (pseudo)time-series single-cell data, FLeCS accurately infers cell dynamics at scale, provides improved functional insights into transcriptional mechanisms perturbed by gene knockouts, both in myeloid differentiation and K562 Perturb-seq experiments, and simulates single-cell trajectories of A549 cells following small-molecule perturbations.

## 4. [LogQuant: Log-Distributed 2-Bit Quantization of KV Cache with Superior Accuracy Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19950) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.19950

**Authors:** Han Chen, Zicong Jiang, Zining Zhang, Bingsheng He, Pingyi Luo, Mian Lu, Yuqiang Chen

**Abstract:** We introduce LogQuant, a groundbreaking 2-bit quantization technique for KV Cache in large language model (LLM) inference, delivering substantial memory savings while preserving superior performance. Previous methods either assume that later tokens are more important or attempt to predict important tokens based on earlier attention patterns. Both approaches, however, can result in performance bottlenecks or frequent mispredictions.   LogQuant takes a different approach. By applying a log-based filtering mechanism, it selectively compresses the KV Cache across the entire context, achieving better performance with the same or even reduced memory footprint compared to existing methods. In benchmark tests, it enhances throughput by 25% and boosts batch size by 60% without increasing memory consumption. For challenging tasks such as Math and Code Completion, LogQuant improves accuracy by 40% to 200% at the same compression ratio, outperforming comparable techniques.LogQuant integrates effortlessly with popular inference frameworks like Python's transformers library. Implementation can be available in https://github.com/Concyclics/LogQuantKV.

**Comment:** LogQuant introduces a novel 2-bit quantization technique for KV Cache in LLM inference, addressing memory efficiency and accuracy preservation. This aligns closely with model compression and efficiency breakthroughs, particularly in LLMs.

## 5. [Fundamental Limits of Perfect Concept Erasure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20098) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20098

**Authors:** Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Avinava Dubey, Ahmad Beirami, Rahul Kidambi, Nicholas Monath, Amr Ahmed, Snigdha Chaturvedi

**Abstract:** Concept erasure is the task of erasing information about a concept (e.g., gender or race) from a representation set while retaining the maximum possible utility -- information from original representations. Concept erasure is useful in several applications, such as removing sensitive concepts to achieve fairness and interpreting the impact of specific concepts on a model's performance. Previous concept erasure techniques have prioritized robustly erasing concepts over retaining the utility of the resultant representations. However, there seems to be an inherent tradeoff between erasure and retaining utility, making it unclear how to achieve perfect concept erasure while maintaining high utility. In this paper, we offer a fresh perspective toward solving this problem by quantifying the fundamental limits of concept erasure through an information-theoretic lens. Using these results, we investigate constraints on the data distribution and the erasure functions required to achieve the limits of perfect concept erasure. Empirically, we show that the derived erasure functions achieve the optimal theoretical bounds. Additionally, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets using GPT-4 representations.

**Comment:** This paper provides an information-theoretic perspective on concept erasure, which is highly relevant to representation learning. The focus on fundamental limits and theoretical bounds adds significant novelty.

## 6. [A Theoretical Framework for Prompt Engineering: Approximating Smooth Functions with Transformer Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20561) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20561

**Authors:** Ryumei Nakada, Wenlong Ji, Tianxi Cai, James Zou, Linjun Zhang

**Abstract:** Prompt engineering has emerged as a powerful technique for guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses, significantly enhancing their performance across diverse tasks. Beyond their role as static predictors, LLMs increasingly function as intelligent agents, capable of reasoning, decision-making, and adapting dynamically to complex environments. However, the theoretical underpinnings of prompt engineering remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework demonstrating that transformer models, when provided with carefully designed prompts, can act as a configurable computational system by emulating a ``virtual'' neural network during inference. Specifically, input prompts effectively translate into the corresponding network configuration, enabling LLMs to adjust their internal computations dynamically. Building on this construction, we establish an approximation theory for $\beta$-times differentiable functions, proving that transformers can approximate such functions with arbitrary precision when guided by appropriately structured prompts. Moreover, our framework provides theoretical justification for several empirically successful prompt engineering techniques, including the use of longer, structured prompts, filtering irrelevant information, enhancing prompt token diversity, and leveraging multi-agent interactions. By framing LLMs as adaptable agents rather than static models, our findings underscore their potential for autonomous reasoning and problem-solving, paving the way for more robust and theoretically grounded advancements in prompt engineering and AI agent design.

**Comment:** This paper provides a theoretical framework for prompt engineering, demonstrating how transformer prompts can approximate smooth functions and act as configurable computational systems. It aligns closely with foundational research in LLMs and offers theoretical insights into their behavior and adaptability.

## 7. [TeleLoRA: Teleporting Model-Specific Alignment Across LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20228) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20228

**Authors:** Xiao Lin, Manoj Acharya, Anirban Roy, Susmit Jha

**Abstract:** Mitigating Trojans in Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of many tasks where alignment data is LLM specific, as different LLMs have different Trojan triggers and trigger behaviors to be removed. In this paper, we introduce TeleLoRA (Teleporting Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel framework that synergizes model-specific alignment data across multiple LLMs to enable zero-shot Trojan mitigation on unseen LLMs without alignment data. TeleLoRA learns a unified generator of LoRA adapter weights by leveraging local activation information across multiple LLMs. This generator is designed to be permutation symmetric to generalize across models with different architectures and sizes. We optimize the model design for memory efficiency, making it feasible to learn with large-scale LLMs with minimal computational resources. Experiments on LLM Trojan mitigation benchmarks demonstrate that TeleLoRA effectively reduces attack success rates while preserving the benign performance of the models.

**Comment:** TeleLoRA introduces a novel framework for low-rank adaptation across LLMs, which aligns with model compression and efficiency topics. The permutation-symmetric generator and memory-efficient design are innovative contributions.

## 8. [ASGO: Adaptive Structured Gradient Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20762) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20762

**Authors:** Kang An, Yuxing Liu, Rui Pan, Shiqian Ma, Donald Goldfarb, Tong Zhang

**Abstract:** Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is a structured optimization problem, because the parameters are naturally represented by matrices and tensors rather than simple vectors. Under this structural representation, it has been widely observed that gradients are low-rank and Hessians are approximately block-wise diagonal. These structured properties are crucial for designing efficient optimization algorithms but may not be utilized by current popular optimizers like Adam. In this paper, we present a novel optimization algorithm ASGO that capitalizes on these properties by employing a preconditioner that is adaptively updated using structured gradients. By fine-grained theoretical analysis, ASGO is proven to achieve superior convergence rates compared to existing structured gradient methods. Based on the convergence theory, we further demonstrate that ASGO can benefit from the low-rank and block-wise diagonal properties. We also discuss practical modifications of ASGO and empirically verify the effectiveness of the algorithm on language model tasks.

**Comment:** The paper introduces ASGO, a novel optimization algorithm leveraging structured gradients and low-rank properties, which aligns with model compression and efficiency breakthroughs. The theoretical analysis and practical modifications add to its novelty.

## 9. [Enhancing Multi-modal Models with Heterogeneous MoE Adapters for Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20633) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20633

**Authors:** Sashuai Zhou, Hai Huang, Yan Xia

**Abstract:** Multi-modal models excel in cross-modal tasks but are computationally expensive due to their billions of parameters. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers a solution by adding small trainable components while freezing pre-trained parameters. However, existing methods primarily focus on uni-modal processing, overlooking the critical modal fusion needed for multi-modal tasks. To fill this gap, we propose heterogeneous mixture of experts adapters that extend the traditional PEFT framework to support multi-modal expert combinations and improve information interaction. Additionally, our approach modifies the affine linear expert design to enable efficient modal fusion in a low-rank space, achieving competitive performance with only 5-8\% of the parameters fine-tuned. Experiments across eight downstream tasks, including visual-audio and text-visual, demonstrate the superior performance of the approach.

**Comment:** The paper proposes heterogeneous MoE adapters for multi-modal fine-tuning, which aligns with the topic of Mixture-of-Experts and architectural innovations. The focus on low-rank space for efficient modal fusion adds to its relevance.

## 10. [Including local feature interactions in deep non-negative matrix factorization networks improves performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20398) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20398

**Authors:** Mahbod Nouri, David Rotermund, Alberto Garcia-Ortiz, Klaus R. Pawelzik

**Abstract:** The brain uses positive signals as a means of signaling. Forward interactions in the early visual cortex are also positive, realized by excitatory synapses. Only local interactions also include inhibition. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures the biological constraint of positive long-range interactions and can be implemented with stochastic spikes. While NMF can serve as an abstract formalization of early neural processing in the visual system, the performance of deep convolutional networks with NMF modules does not match that of CNNs of similar size. However, when the local NMF modules are each followed by a module that mixes the NMF's positive activities, the performances on the benchmark data exceed that of vanilla deep convolutional networks of similar size. This setting can be considered a biologically more plausible emulation of the processing in cortical (hyper-)columns with the potential to improve the performance of deep networks.

**Comment:** The paper explores the integration of local feature interactions in deep non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) networks, which aligns with representation learning and architectural insights. The focus on improving performance through biologically plausible mechanisms adds a novel perspective.

## 11. [Network Inversion for Generating Confidently Classified Counterfeits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20187) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20187

**Authors:** Pirzada Suhail, Amit Sethi

**Abstract:** In machine learning, especially with vision classifiers, generating inputs that are confidently classified by the model is essential for understanding its decision boundaries and behavior. However, creating such samples that are confidently classified yet distinct from the training data distribution is a challenge. Traditional methods often modify existing inputs, but they don't always ensure confident classification. In this work, we extend network inversion techniques to generate Confidently Classified Counterfeits-synthetic samples that are confidently classified by the model despite being significantly different from the training data. We achieve this by modifying the generator's conditioning mechanism from soft vector conditioning to one-hot vector conditioning and applying Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the one-hot vectors and the classifier's output distribution. This encourages the generator to produce samples that are both plausible and confidently classified. Generating Confidently Classified Counterfeits is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications where models must exhibit confidence only on data within the training distribution. By generating such counterfeits, we challenge the assumption that high-confidence predictions are always indicative of in-distribution data, providing deeper insights into the model's limitations and decision-making process.

**Comment:** The paper explores network inversion techniques to generate confidently classified counterfeits, which provides insights into model behavior and decision boundaries. This aligns with representation learning, particularly in understanding how models encode information and their limitations.

## 12. [TraNCE: Transformative Non-linear Concept Explainer for CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20230) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20230

**Authors:** Ugochukwu Ejike Akpudo, Yongsheng Gao, Jun Zhou, Andrew Lewis

**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have succeeded remarkably in various computer vision tasks. However, they are not intrinsically explainable. While the feature-level understanding of CNNs reveals where the models looked, concept-based explainability methods provide insights into what the models saw. However, their assumption of linear reconstructability of image activations fails to capture the intricate relationships within these activations. Their Fidelity-only approach to evaluating global explanations also presents a new concern. For the first time, we address these limitations with the novel Transformative Nonlinear Concept Explainer (TraNCE) for CNNs. Unlike linear reconstruction assumptions made by existing methods, TraNCE captures the intricate relationships within the activations. This study presents three original contributions to the CNN explainability literature: (i) An automatic concept discovery mechanism based on variational autoencoders (VAEs). This transformative concept discovery process enhances the identification of meaningful concepts from image activations. (ii) A visualization module that leverages the Bessel function to create a smooth transition between prototypical image pixels, revealing not only what the CNN saw but also what the CNN avoided, thereby mitigating the challenges of concept duplication as documented in previous works. (iii) A new metric, the Faith score, integrates both Coherence and Fidelity for a comprehensive evaluation of explainer faithfulness and consistency.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a novel concept explainer for CNNs using variational autoencoders and a new evaluation metric. It aligns with representation learning and explainability, particularly in understanding how CNNs encode information, making it relevant to foundational research.

## 13. [Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning with Token Redundancy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20282) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.20282

**Authors:** Kwonyoung Kim, Jungin Park, Jin Kim, Hyeongjun Kwon, Kwanghoon Sohn

**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) aims to transfer pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks by learning a small number of parameters. Compared to traditional fine-tuning, which updates the entire model, PET significantly reduces storage and transfer costs for each task regardless of exponentially increasing pre-trained model capacity. However, most PET methods inherit the inference latency of their large backbone models and often introduce additional computational overhead due to additional modules (e.g. adapters), limiting their practicality for compute-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning (FPET), a novel approach that enhances inference speed and training efficiency while maintaining high storage efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play token redundancy reduction module delicately designed for PET. This module refines tokens from the self-attention layer using an adapter to learn the accurate similarity between tokens and cuts off the tokens through a fully-differentiable token merging strategy, which uses a straight-through estimator for optimal token reduction. Experimental results prove that our FPET achieves faster inference and higher memory efficiency than the pre-trained backbone while keeping competitive performance on par with state-of-the-art PET methods.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a token redundancy reduction module for parameter-efficient tuning, which aligns with model compression and efficiency improvements. The focus on reducing inference latency and memory usage is a notable contribution.
