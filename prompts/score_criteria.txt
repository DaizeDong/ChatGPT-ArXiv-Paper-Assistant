## Scoring Criteria

> The "Relevance" score measures how closely the paper aligns with the core topics of the prompt.
> The "Novelty" score assesses the originality and impact of the paper.
> They are two **ORTHONORMAL** axes and **SHOULD NOT** be confused with each other. E.g., a paper with high relevance can be of low novelty, or vice versa.

### Relevance Scoring

- Relevance 9-10 (Completely Relevant)
  - Focus: Fully aligned with core topics, score the highest if also contains keywords in it.
  - Keywords: “Mixture of Experts (MoE),” “Representation Learning,” “Compression,” “Sparse/Sparsity,” “Pruning,” “Quantization,” “Low-rank,” “Scaling,” “Foundation Models,” etc.
  - Examples: Papers focused on foundational methods or theoretical research, whose titles contain topic keywords like "MoE".

- Relevance 7-8 (Relevant)
  - Focus: Clearly tied to our main topics, may not fully hit the interest in foundational methods.
  - Examples: Pure research on representation/architecture on MoE with no other domain focus.

- Relevance 5-6 (Optional)
  - Focus: Link to our topics—covers relevant ideas but also includes another area of interest.
  - Examples: Work referencing MoE centered on another domain.

- Relevance 3-4 (Irrelevant)
  - Focus: Largely outside our interests, with no association to our topics.
  - Examples: Application-focused papers like using MoE to solve a problem in real world.

- Relevance 1-2 (Ignore)
  - Focus: Purely unrelated to our topics. Completely a different domain.
  - Exception: If you think it is an emerging trend (that may lead to a thorough breakthrough in the future), you can give a score of 9-10. (Usually a very rare concept that belongs to the fundamental research)

### Novelty Scoring

- Novelty 9-10 (Breakthrough)
  - Definition: Groundbreaking methods/theory introducing new directions or solving major challenges.
  - Examples: Entirely new paradigm for foundational models; a novel theory transforming representation learning.

- Novelty 7-8 (Improvements)
  - Definition: Substantial insights/enhancements, though not a full paradigm shift.
  - Examples: Modifications on existing methods yielding significantly better results.

- Novelty 5-6 (Moderate)
  - Definition: Incremental contributions with possible long-term benefits, not immediately transformative.
  - Examples: Moderately novel extension to an existing architecture; refining current methods without fundamentally altering them.

- Novelty 3-4 (Tangential)
  - Definition: Minor or domain-specific improvements with limited broader impact.
  - Examples: Slight modifications to known methods with strange motivation; purely engineering jobs like a new benchmark/dataset.

- Novelty 1-2 (Low)
  - Definition: Minimal originality, applying standard approaches without real innovation.
  - Examples: Using an off-the-shelf model without adding new insights; purely application-driven studies like finetuning a pretrained model using existing methods.
