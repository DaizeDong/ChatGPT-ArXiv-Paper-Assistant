        "abstract": "Language models usually use left-to-right (L2R) autoregressive factorization. However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability and directional conditional entropy. We ablate the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.",

The learned PDE representations naturally express the spatiotemporal dynamics in data in neural network hidden space, enabling increased power for dynamical modeling. Solving the PDE representations in a compute and memory-efficient way, however, is a significant challenge. We develop a native, GPU-capable, parallel, sparse, and differentiable multigrid solver specialized for linear partial differential equations that acts as a module in Mechanistic PDE Networks. Leveraging the PDE solver, we propose a discovery architecture that can discover nonlinear PDEs in complex settings while also being robust to noise.

        "abstract": "Recent research across mathematical problem solving, proof assistant programming and multimodal jailbreaking documents a striking finding: when (multimodal) language model tackle a suite of tasks with multiple attempts per task -- succeeding if any attempt is correct -- then the negative log of the average success rate scales a power law in the number of attempts. In this work, we identify an apparent puzzle: a simple mathematical calculation predicts that on each problem, the failure rate should fall exponentially with the number of attempts. We confirm this prediction empirically, raising a question: from where does aggregate polynomial scaling emerge? We then answer this question by demonstrating per-problem exponential scaling can be made consistent with aggregate polynomial scaling if the distribution of single-attempt success probabilities is heavy tailed such that a small fraction of tasks with extremely low success probabilities collectively warp the aggregate success trend into a power law - even as each problem scales exponentially on its own. We further demonstrate that this distributional perspective explains previously observed deviations from power law scaling, and provides a simple method for forecasting the power law exponent with an order of magnitude lower relative error, or equivalently, ${\\sim}2-4$ orders of magnitude less inference compute. Overall, our work contributes to a better understanding of how neural language model performance improves with scaling inference compute and the development of scaling-predictable evaluations of (multimodal) language models.",

In this work, we propose $\\textit{Active Multi-Preference Optimization}$ (AMPO), a novel approach that combines on-policy generation, a multi-preference group-contrastive loss, and active subset selection. Specifically, we score and embed large candidate pools of responses and then select a small, yet informative, subset that covers reward extremes and distinct semantic clusters for preference optimization. Our contrastive training scheme is capable of identifying not only the best and worst answers but also subtle, underexplored modes that are crucial for robust alignment. Theoretically, we provide guarantees for expected reward maximization using our active selection method, and empirically, AMPO achieves state-of-the-art results on $\\textit{AlpacaEval}$ using Llama 8B.",

        "abstract": "Providing Large Language Models with relevant contextual knowledge at inference time has been shown to greatly improve the quality of their generations. This is often achieved by prepending informative passages of text, or 'contexts', retrieved from external knowledge bases to their input. However, processing additional contexts online incurs significant computation costs that scale with their length. State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising solution by allowing a database of contexts to be mapped onto fixed-dimensional states from which to start the generation. A key challenge arises when attempting to leverage information present across multiple contexts, since there is no straightforward way to condition generation on multiple independent states in existing SSMs. To address this, we leverage a simple mathematical relation derived from SSM dynamics to compose multiple states into one that efficiently approximates the effect of concatenating textual contexts. Since the temporal ordering of contexts can often be uninformative, we enforce permutation-invariance by efficiently averaging states obtained via our composition algorithm across all possible context orderings. We evaluate our resulting method on WikiText and MSMARCO in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and show that we can match the strongest performing baseline while enjoying on average 5.4x speedup.",

        "abstract": "An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

In this paper, we unveil and causalize CoT from a causal perspective to ensure both correctness and understandability of all reasoning steps (to the best of our knowledge, the first such). We model causality of CoT via structural causal models (SCM) to unveil the reasoning mechanism of CoT. To measure the causality of CoT, we define the CoT Average Causal Effect (CACE) to test the causal relations between steps. For those steps without causality (wrong or unintelligible steps), we design a role-playing causal query algorithm to causalize these steps, resulting a causalized CoT with all steps correct and understandable. Experimental results on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that the causal errors commonly in steps are effectively corrected and the reasoning ability of LLMs is significantly improved.",

This paper builds on the foundational work of Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) by advancing the methodology of parameter importance estimation using the Hessian matrix. Unlike previous approaches that rely on approximations, we introduce Optimal Brain Apoptosis (OBA), a novel pruning method that calculates the Hessian-vector product value directly for each parameter.

These methods, however, assess the importance of heads independently, overlooking their cooperative contributions within the model, which may result in a deviation from their true impact on model performance. In light of this limitation, we propose CoKV, a novel method that models the cooperation between heads in model inference as a cooperative game. By evaluating the contribution of each head within the cooperative game, CoKV can allocate the cache budget more effectively.

The extent to which SAEs can help us understand computations is unclear because they are not designed to \"sparsify\" computations in any sense, only latent activations. To solve this, we propose Jacobian SAEs (JSAEs), which yield not only sparsity in the input and output activations of a given model component but also sparsity in the computation (formally, the Jacobian) connecting them. With a na\\\"ive implementation, the Jacobians in LLMs would be computationally intractable due to their size. One key technical contribution is thus finding an efficient way of computing Jacobians in this setup. We find that JSAEs extract a relatively large degree of computational sparsity while preserving downstream LLM performance approximately as well as traditional SAEs. We also show that Jacobians are a reasonable proxy for computational sparsity because MLPs are approximately linear when rewritten in the JSAE basis. Lastly, we show that JSAEs achieve a greater degree of computational sparsity on pre-trained LLMs than on the equivalent randomized LLM. This shows that the sparsity of the computational graph appears to be a property that LLMs learn through training, and suggests that JSAEs might be more suitable for understanding learned transformer computations than standard SAEs.",

Given a likelihood function and a Gaussian random element representing the prior, the corresponding Bayes posterior measure $\\Pi_{\\text{B}}$ can be obtained as the stationary distribution of an RKHS-valued Langevin diffusion. We approximate the infinite-dimensional Langevin diffusion via a projection onto the first $M$ components of the Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\\`eve expansion. Exploiting the thus obtained approximate posterior for these $M$ components, we perform inference for $\\Pi_{\\text{B}}$ by relying on the law of total probability and a sufficiency assumption. The resulting method scales as $O(M^3+JM^2)$, where $J$ is the number of samples produced from the posterior measure $\\Pi_{\\text{B}}$. Interestingly, the algorithm recovers the posterior arising from the sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) (see Titsias, 2009) as a special case, owed to the fact that the sufficiency assumption underlies both methods. However, whereas the SVGP is parametrically constrained to be a Gaussian process, our method is based on a non-parametric variational family $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^M)$ consisting of all probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}^M$. As a result, our method is provably close to the optimal $M$-dimensional variational approximation of the Bayes posterior $\\Pi_{\\text{B}}$ in $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^M)$ for convex and Lipschitz continuous negative log likelihoods, and coincides with SVGP for the special case of a Gaussian error likelihood.",

        "abstract": "Algebraic model counting unifies many inference tasks on logic formulas by exploiting semirings. Rather than focusing on inference, we consider learning, especially in statistical-relational and neurosymbolic AI, which combine logical, probabilistic and neural representations. Concretely, we show that the very same semiring perspective of algebraic model counting also applies to learning. This allows us to unify various learning algorithms by generalizing gradients and backpropagation to different semirings. Furthermore, we show how cancellation and ordering properties of a semiring can be exploited for more memory-efficient backpropagation. This allows us to obtain some interesting variations of state-of-the-art gradient-based optimisation methods for probabilistic logical models. We also discuss why algebraic model counting on tractable circuits does not lead to more efficient second-order optimization. Empirically, our algebraic backpropagation exhibits considerable speed-ups as compared to existing approaches.",

In order to accurately reflect the underlying physics of the problem, domain knowledge must be encoded into the machine learning algorithms. In this work, inspired by field theory, we propose a new set of machine learning models called effective field neural networks (EFNNs) that can automatically and efficiently capture important many-body interactions through multiple self-refining processes. Taking the classical $3$-spin infinite-range model and the quantum double exchange model as case studies, we explicitly demonstrate that EFNNs significantly outperform fully-connected deep neural networks (DNNs) and the effective model. Furthermore, with the help of convolution operations, the EFNNs learned in a small system can be seamlessly used in a larger system without additional training and the relative errors even decrease, which further demonstrates the efficacy of EFNNs in representing core physical behaviors.",

Boltzmann generators tackle this problem by pairing powerful normalizing flows with importance sampling to obtain statistically independent samples under the target distribution. In this paper, we extend the Boltzmann generator framework and introduce Sequential Boltzmann generators (SBG) with two key improvements. The first is a highly efficient non-equivariant Transformer-based normalizing flow operating directly on all-atom Cartesian coordinates. In contrast to equivariant continuous flows of prior methods, we leverage exactly invertible non-equivariant architectures which are highly efficient both during sample generation and likelihood computation. As a result, this unlocks more sophisticated inference strategies beyond standard importance sampling. More precisely, as a second key improvement we perform inference-time scaling of flow samples using annealed Langevin dynamics which transports samples toward the target distribution leading to lower variance (annealed) importance weights which enable higher fidelity resampling with sequential Monte Carlo. SBG achieves state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. all metrics on molecular systems, demonstrating the first equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of tri, tetra, and hexapeptides that were so far intractable for prior Boltzmann generators.",

Addressing this issue and developing more effective training strategies have become central challenges in generative model research. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon theoretically within a novel framework, where generative models are iteratively trained on a combination of newly collected real data and synthetic data from the previous training step. To develop an optimal training strategy for integrating real and synthetic data, we evaluate the performance of a weighted training scheme in various scenarios, including Gaussian distribution estimation and linear regression. We theoretically characterize the impact of the mixing proportion and weighting scheme of synthetic data on the final model's performance. Our key finding is that, across different settings, the optimal weighting scheme under different proportions of synthetic data asymptotically follows a unified expression, revealing a fundamental trade-off between leveraging synthetic data and generative model performance. Notably, in some cases, the optimal weight assigned to real data corresponds precisely to the reciprocal of the golden ratio. Finally, we validate our theoretical results on extensive simulated datasets and a real tabular dataset.",

These challenges include the non-differentiable interactions between components, making end-to-end gradient optimization infeasible. Additionally, system-level preferences cannot be directly translated into component-level preferences, further complicating alignment. We address the issues by formulating compound AI systems as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), capturing the connections between agents and the data generation processes. We propose a system-level DPO (SysDPO) to jointly align compound systems by adapting the DPO to operate on these DAGs.

We then leverage this classification framework to demonstrate that the underlying problem solved in these algorithms is under-specified, making them susceptible to probability collapse of the winner-loser responses. We address this by proposing a set of constraints designed to control the movement of probability mass between the winner and loser in the reference and target policies. Our resulting algorithm, which we call Constrained Controlled Classification DPO (\\texttt{C-3DPO}), has a meaningful RLHF interpretation.

In the first application, we show that this loss function can enable the extraction of dynamical parameters from non-temporal datasets, including timestamp-free measurements from steady non-equilibrium systems such as noisy Lorenz systems and gene regulatory networks. In the second application, when coupled with a density estimator, this loss facilitates density estimation when the dynamic equations are known. For density estimation, we propose a density estimator that integrates a Gaussian Mixture Model with a normalizing flow model. It simultaneously estimates normalized density, energy, and score functions from both empirical data and dynamics. It is compatible with a variety of data-based training methodologies, including maximum likelihood and score matching. It features a latent space akin to a modern Hopfield network, where the inherent Hopfield energy effectively assigns low densities to sparsely populated data regions, addressing common challenges in neural density estimators. Additionally, this Hopfield-like energy enables direct and rapid data manipulation through the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) rule, facilitating tasks such as denoising and clustering. Our work demonstrates a principled framework for leveraging the complex interdependencies between dynamics and density estimation, as illustrated through synthetic examples that clarify the underlying theoretical intuitions.",

Towards this, we first formulate knowledge distillation as an entropy-regularized value optimization problem. Adopting Path Consistency Learning to solve this, leads to a new knowledge distillation algorithm using on-policy and off-policy demonstrations. We extend this using constrained reinforcement learning to a framework that incorporates the use of the teacher model as a test-time reference, within constraints. In this situation, akin to a human learner, the model needs to learn not only the learning material, but also the relative difficulty of different sections to prioritize for seeking teacher help.

While current researches continue to explore the benefits of increasing test-time compute by extending the CoT lengths of Large Language Models (LLMs), we are concerned about a potential issue hidden behind the current pursuit of test-time scaling: Would excessively scaling the CoT length actually bring adverse effects to a model's reasoning performance? Our explorations on mathematical reasoning tasks reveal an unexpected finding that scaling with longer CoTs can indeed impair the reasoning performance of LLMs in certain domains. Moreover, we discover that there exists an optimal scaled length distribution that differs across different domains. Based on these insights, we propose a Thinking-Optimal Scaling strategy. Our method first uses a small set of seed data with varying response length distributions to teach the model to adopt different reasoning efforts for deep thinking. Then, the model selects its shortest correct response under different reasoning efforts on additional problems for self-improvement.

While original KAN layers were only capable of representing the addition operator, the recently-proposed MultKAN layer combines addition and multiplication subnodes in an effort to improve representation performance. Here, we find that MultKAN layers suffer from a few key drawbacks including limited applicability in output layers, bulky parameterizations with extraneous activations, and the inclusion of complex hyperparameters. To address these issues, we propose LeanKANs, a direct and modular replacement for MultKAN and traditional AddKAN layers. LeanKANs address these three drawbacks of MultKAN through general applicability as output layers, significantly reduced parameter counts for a given network structure, and a smaller set of hyperparameters. As a one-to-one layer replacement for standard AddKAN and MultKAN layers, LeanKAN is able to provide these benefits to traditional KAN learning problems as well as augmented KAN structures in which it serves as the backbone, such as KAN Ordinary Differential Equations (KAN-ODEs) or Deep Operator KANs (DeepOKAN). We demonstrate LeanKAN's simplicity and efficiency in a series of demonstrations carried out across both a standard KAN toy problem and a KAN-ODE dynamical system modeling problem, where we find that its sparser parameterization and compact structure serve to increase its expressivity and learning capability, leading it to outperform similar and even much larger MultKANs in various tasks.",

In this work, we aim to develop a general framework that enhances the utility of fine-tuning-based unlearning methods. To achieve this goal, we first investigate the common property between GA-based and suppression-based methods. We unveil that GA-based methods unlearn by distinguishing the target data (i.e., the data to be removed) and suppressing related generations, which is essentially the same strategy employed by suppression-based methods. Inspired by this finding, we introduce Gated Representation UNlearning (GRUN) which has two components: a soft gate function for distinguishing target data and a suppression module using Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) to adjust representations rather than model parameters. Experiments show that GRUN significantly improves the unlearning and utility. Meanwhile, it is general for fine-tuning-based methods, efficient and promising for sequential unlearning.",

The Right (Left) Projection Ratio evaluates the fidelity of the projection of an image (label) onto the computed right (left) singular vectors. We observe that both ratios are able to identify the presence of class imbalance for an image classification problem. Additionally, the Right Projection Ratio, which only requires unlabeled data, is found to be correlated to the model's performance when applied to image segmentation. This suggests the Right Projection Ratio could be a useful metric to estimate how likely the model is to perform well on a sample.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but remain prone to hallucinations. Detecting hallucinations is essential for safety-critical applications, and recent methods leverage attention map properties to this end, though their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we investigate the spectral features of attention maps by interpreting them as adjacency matrices of graph structures. We propose the $\\text{LapEigvals}$ method, which utilises the top-$k$ eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from the attention maps as an input to hallucination detection probes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance among attention-based methods. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the robustness and generalisation of $\\text{LapEigvals}$, paving the way for future advancements in the hallucination detection domain.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to well-designed adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense strategies have been proposed, many are tailored to the specific attacks or tasks and often fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose Tensor Network Purification (TNP), a novel model-free adversarial purification method by a specially designed tensor network decomposition algorithm. TNP depends neither on the pre-trained generative model nor the specific dataset, resulting in strong robustness across diverse adversarial scenarios. To this end, the key challenge lies in relaxing Gaussian-noise assumptions of classical decompositions and accommodating the unknown distribution of adversarial perturbations. Unlike the low-rank representation of classical decompositions, TNP aims to reconstruct the unobserved clean examples from an adversarial example. Specifically, TNP leverages progressive downsampling and introduces a novel adversarial optimization objective to address the challenge of minimizing reconstruction error but without inadvertently restoring adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively across various norm threats, attack types, and tasks, providing a versatile and promising adversarial purification technique.",

The key idea is to generate a tree from the original graph that retains critical dynamical properties. By correlating these properties with learning attributes, we construct effective learning backbones. We evaluate the performance of our ZF-based backbones in graph classification tasks across eight datasets and six baseline models. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques. Additionally, we explore extensions using node distance metrics to further enhance the framework's utility.",

        "abstract": "Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to protect sensitive data during the training of machine learning models, but its privacy guarantees often come at the cost of model performance, largely due to the inherent challenge of accurately quantifying privacy loss. While recent efforts have strengthened privacy guarantees by focusing solely on the final output and bounded domain cases, they still impose restrictive assumptions, such as convexity and other parameter limitations, and often lack a thorough analysis of utility. In this paper, we provide rigorous privacy and utility characterization for DPSGD for smooth loss functions in both bounded and unbounded domains. We track the privacy loss over multiple iterations by exploiting the noisy smooth-reduction property and establish the utility analysis by leveraging the projection's non-expansiveness and clipped SGD properties. In particular, we show that for DPSGD with a bounded domain, (i) the privacy loss can still converge without the convexity assumption, and (ii) a smaller bounded diameter can improve both privacy and utility simultaneously under certain conditions. Numerical results validate our results.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce vocabulary curriculum learning, an approach that improves pretraining efficiency with log-linear scaling gains relative to vocabulary size. Our method alternates between entropy-guided vocabulary expansion and model optimization, enabling models to learn transferable representations across diverse tokenization granularities. This approach naturally gives rise to an optimal computation allocation pattern: longer tokens capture predictable content, while shorter tokens focus on more complex, harder-to-predict contexts. Experiments on small-scale GPT models demonstrate improved scaling efficiency, reinforcing the effectiveness of dynamic tokenization. We release our code to support further research and plan to extend our experiments to larger models and diverse domains.",

This link function (referred to as the Euler logarithm) is associated with a wide class of generalized entropies. In order to derive novel GEG/MD updates, we estimate generalized exponential function, which closely approximates the inverse of the Euler two-parameter logarithm. The characteristic/shape and properties of the Euler logarithm and its inverse -- deformed exponential functions are tuned by two or even more hyperparameters. By learning these hyperparameters, we can adapt to distribution of training data, and we can adjust them to achieve desired properties of gradient descent algorithms. The concept of generalized entropies and associated deformed logarithms provide deeper insight into novel gradient descent updates.   In literature, there exist nowadays over fifty mathematically well-defined entropic functionals and associated deformed logarithms, so impossible to investigate all of them in one research paper. Therefore, we focus here on a wide-class of trace-form entropies and associated generalized logarithm.

Despite initial studies, a substantial gap remains between the interpretability of LLMs and MMFMs. This survey explores two key aspects: (1) the adaptation of LLM interpretability methods to multimodal models and (2) understanding the mechanistic differences between unimodal language models and crossmodal systems. By systematically reviewing current MMFM analysis techniques, we propose a structured taxonomy of interpretability methods, compare insights across unimodal and multimodal architectures, and highlight critical research gaps.",
