## 1. [Mixture of Group Experts for Learning Invariant Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09265) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09265

**Authors:** Lei Kang, Jia Li, Mi Tian, Hua Huang

**Abstract:** Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models effectively increase the number of parameters while maintaining consistent computational costs per token. However, vanilla MoE models often suffer from limited diversity and specialization among experts, constraining their performance and scalability, especially as the number of experts increases. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse representation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from sparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose a group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed Mixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by imposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the original MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D topographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure enables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations, thereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization. Comprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image classification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially outperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our approach provides a simple yet effective solution to scale the number of experts and reduce redundancy among them. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be publicly released.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel group sparse regularization approach for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, directly addressing architectural innovations and representation learning.

## 2. [Towards Combinatorial Interpretability of Neural Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08842) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.08842

**Authors:** Micah Adler, Dan Alistarh, Nir Shavit

**Abstract:** We introduce combinatorial interpretability, a methodology for understanding neural computation by analyzing the combinatorial structures in the sign-based categorization of a network's weights and biases. We demonstrate its power through feature channel coding, a theory that explains how neural networks compute Boolean expressions and potentially underlies other categories of neural network computation. According to this theory, features are computed via feature channels: unique cross-neuron encodings shared among the inputs the feature operates on. Because different feature channels share neurons, the neurons are polysemantic and the channels interfere with one another, making the computation appear inscrutable.   We show how to decipher these computations by analyzing a network's feature channel coding, offering complete mechanistic interpretations of several small neural networks that were trained with gradient descent. Crucially, this is achieved via static combinatorial analysis of the weight matrices, without examining activations or training new autoencoding networks. Feature channel coding reframes the superposition hypothesis, shifting the focus from neuron activation directionality in high-dimensional space to the combinatorial structure of codes. It also allows us for the first time to exactly quantify and explain the relationship between a network's parameter size and its computational capacity (i.e. the set of features it can compute with low error), a relationship that is implicitly at the core of many modern scaling laws.   Though our initial studies of feature channel coding are restricted to Boolean functions, we believe they provide a rich, controlled, and informative research space, and that the path we propose for combinatorial interpretation of neural computation can provide a basis for understanding both artificial and biological neural circuits.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel combinatorial interpretability framework for understanding neural computation, which aligns with foundational research in representation learning and training dynamics.

## 3. [Towards Weaker Variance Assumptions for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09951) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09951

**Authors:** Ahmet Alacaoglu, Yura Malitsky, Stephen J. Wright

**Abstract:** We revisit a classical assumption for analyzing stochastic gradient algorithms where the squared norm of the stochastic subgradient (or the variance for smooth problems) is allowed to grow as fast as the squared norm of the optimization variable. We contextualize this assumption in view of its inception in the 1960s, its seemingly independent appearance in the recent literature, its relationship to weakest-known variance assumptions for analyzing stochastic gradient algorithms, and its relevance in deterministic problems for non-Lipschitz nonsmooth convex optimization. We build on and extend a connection recently made between this assumption and the Halpern iteration. For convex nonsmooth, and potentially stochastic, optimization, we analyze horizon-free, anytime algorithms with last-iterate rates. For problems beyond simple constrained optimization, such as convex problems with functional constraints or regularized convex-concave min-max problems, we obtain rates for optimality measures that do not require boundedness of the feasible set.

**Comment:** The paper revisits variance assumptions in stochastic optimization, which aligns with the 'Emerging Trends' criterion by challenging established assumptions and providing theoretical insights.

## 4. [PQS (Prune, Quantize, and Sort): Low-Bitwidth Accumulation of Dot Products in Neural Network Computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09064) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09064

**Authors:** Vikas Natesh, H. T. Kung

**Abstract:** We present PQS, which uses three techniques together - Prune, Quantize, and Sort - to achieve low-bitwidth accumulation of dot products in neural network computations. In conventional quantized (e.g., 8-bit) dot products, partial results are accumulated into wide (e.g., 32-bit) accumulators to avoid overflows when accumulating intermediate partial sums. However, such wide accumulators increase memory bandwidth usage and reduce energy efficiency. We show that iterative N:M pruning in floating point followed by quantization to 8 (or fewer) bits, and accumulation of partial products in a sorted order ("small to large") allows for accurate, compressed models with short dot product lengths that do not require wide accumulators. We design, analyze, and implement the PQS algorithm to eliminate accumulation overflows at inference time for several neural networks. Our method offers a 2.5x reduction in accumulator bitwidth while achieving model accuracy on par with floating-point baselines for multiple image classification tasks.

**Comment:** The PQS method combines pruning, quantization, and sorting for low-bitwidth accumulation, directly addressing model compression and efficiency.

## 5. [Continuum-Interaction-Driven Intelligence: Human-Aligned Neural Architecture via Crystallized Reasoning and Fluid Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09301) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09301

**Authors:** Pengcheng Zhou, Zhiqiang Nie, Haochen Li

**Abstract:** Current AI systems based on probabilistic neural networks, such as large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities yet face critical challenges including hallucination, unpredictability, and misalignment with human decision-making. These issues fundamentally stem from the over-reliance on randomized (probabilistic) neural networks-oversimplified models of biological neural networks-while neglecting the role of procedural reasoning (chain-of-thought) in trustworthy decision-making. Inspired by the human cognitive duality of fluid intelligence (flexible generation) and crystallized intelligence (structured knowledge), this study proposes a dual-channel intelligent architecture that integrates probabilistic generation (LLMs) with white-box procedural reasoning (chain-of-thought) to construct interpretable, continuously learnable, and human-aligned AI systems. Concretely, this work: (1) redefines chain-of-thought as a programmable crystallized intelligence carrier, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and decision verification through multi-turn interaction frameworks; (2) introduces a task-driven modular network design that explicitly demarcates the functional boundaries between randomized generation and procedural control to address trustworthiness in vertical-domain applications; (3) demonstrates that multi-turn interaction is a necessary condition for intelligence emergence, with dialogue depth positively correlating with the system's human-alignment degree. This research not only establishes a new paradigm for trustworthy AI deployment but also provides theoretical foundations for next-generation human-AI collaborative systems.

**Comment:** Proposes a dual-channel architecture inspired by human cognitive duality, integrating probabilistic generation with procedural reasoning. This aligns with the 'Model Architecture' criterion, offering insights into architectural innovations for trustworthy AI.

## 6. [Expressivity of Quadratic Neural ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09385) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09385

**Authors:** Joshua Hanson, Maxim Raginsky

**Abstract:** This work focuses on deriving quantitative approximation error bounds for neural ordinary differential equations having at most quadratic nonlinearities in the dynamics. The simple dynamics of this model form demonstrates how expressivity can be derived primarily from iteratively composing many basic elementary operations, versus from the complexity of those elementary operations themselves. Like the analog differential analyzer and universal polynomial DAEs, the expressivity is derived instead primarily from the "depth" of the model. These results contribute to our understanding of what depth specifically imparts to the capabilities of deep learning architectures.

**Comment:** The paper provides theoretical bounds on the expressivity of quadratic neural ODEs, focusing on the role of depth in model capabilities. This aligns with foundational research in representation learning and model architecture.

## 7. [DL-QAT: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Quantization-Aware Training for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09223) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09223

**Authors:** Wenjin Ke, Zhe Li, Dong Li, Lu Tian, Emad Barsoum

**Abstract:** Improving the efficiency of inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical area of research. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is a popular technique, but it often faces challenges at low-bit levels, particularly in downstream tasks. Quantization-aware Training (QAT) can alleviate this problem, but it requires significantly more computational resources. To tackle this, we introduced Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Quantization-Aware Training (DL-QAT), which merges the advantages of QAT while training only less than 1% of the total parameters. Specifically, we introduce a group-specific quantization magnitude to adjust the overall scale of each quantization group. Within each quantization group, we use LoRA matrices to update the weight size and direction in the quantization space. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families. The results show significant improvements over our baseline method across different quantization granularities. For instance, for LLaMA-7B, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.2% in MMLU on 3-bit LLaMA-7B model. Additionally, our quantization results on pre-trained models also surpass previous QAT methods, demonstrating the superior performance and efficiency of our approach.

**Comment:** The paper introduces DL-QAT, a low-rank quantization-aware training method for LLMs, aligning with the 'Model Compression' criterion by addressing efficiency in LLMs with novel quantization techniques.

## 8. [In almost all shallow analytic neural network optimization landscapes, efficient minimizers have strongly convex neighborhoods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08867) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.08867

**Authors:** Felix Benning, Steffen Dereich

**Abstract:** Whether or not a local minimum of a cost function has a strongly convex neighborhood greatly influences the asymptotic convergence rate of optimizers. In this article, we rigorously analyze the prevalence of this property for the mean squared error induced by shallow, 1-hidden layer neural networks with analytic activation functions when applied to regression problems. The parameter space is divided into two domains: the 'efficient domain' (all parameters for which the respective realization function cannot be generated by a network having a smaller number of neurons) and the 'redundant domain' (the remaining parameters). In almost all regression problems on the efficient domain the optimization landscape only features local minima that are strongly convex. Formally, we will show that for certain randomly picked regression problems the optimization landscape is almost surely a Morse function on the efficient domain. The redundant domain has significantly smaller dimension than the efficient domain and on this domain, potential local minima are never isolated.

**Comment:** The paper provides theoretical insights into the optimization landscape of shallow neural networks, which aligns with foundational research in representation learning and training dynamics.

## 9. [From Tokens to Lattices: Emergent Lattice Structures in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08778) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.08778

**Authors:** Bo Xiong, Steffen Staab

**Abstract:** Pretrained masked language models (MLMs) have demonstrated an impressive capability to comprehend and encode conceptual knowledge, revealing a lattice structure among concepts. This raises a critical question: how does this conceptualization emerge from MLM pretraining? In this paper, we explore this problem from the perspective of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a mathematical framework that derives concept lattices from the observations of object-attribute relationships. We show that the MLM's objective implicitly learns a \emph{formal context} that describes objects, attributes, and their dependencies, which enables the reconstruction of a concept lattice through FCA. We propose a novel framework for concept lattice construction from pretrained MLMs and investigate the origin of the inductive biases of MLMs in lattice structure learning. Our framework differs from previous work because it does not rely on human-defined concepts and allows for discovering "latent" concepts that extend beyond human definitions. We create three datasets for evaluation, and the empirical results verify our hypothesis.

**Comment:** The paper investigates how conceptual knowledge emerges in pretrained masked language models using Formal Concept Analysis, which provides theoretical insights into representation learning.

## 10. [Position: Beyond Euclidean -- Foundation Models Should Embrace Non-Euclidean Geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08896) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.08896

**Authors:** Neil He, Jiahong Liu, Buze Zhang, Ngoc Bui, Ali Maatouk, Menglin Yang, Irwin King, Melanie Weber, Rex Ying

**Abstract:** In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean space has been the de facto geometric setting for machine learning architectures. However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with fundamental limitations. At a large scale, real-world data often exhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures, such as multi-way relationships, hierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling, in a variety of domains, such as languages, vision, and the natural sciences. It is challenging to effectively capture these structures within the constraints of Euclidean spaces. This position paper argues that moving beyond Euclidean geometry is not merely an optional enhancement but a necessity to maintain the scaling law for the next-generation of foundation models. By adopting these geometries, foundation models could more efficiently leverage the aforementioned structures. Task-aware adaptability that dynamically reconfigures embeddings to match the geometry of downstream applications could further enhance efficiency and expressivity. Our position is supported by a series of theoretical and empirical investigations of prevalent foundation models.Finally, we outline a roadmap for integrating non-Euclidean geometries into foundation models, including strategies for building geometric foundation models via fine-tuning, training from scratch, and hybrid approaches.

**Comment:** This position paper argues for the adoption of non-Euclidean geometries in foundation models, which aligns with emerging trends and architectural innovations. It provides a theoretical perspective on improving model scalability and efficiency.

## 11. [KeepKV: Eliminating Output Perturbation in KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLMs Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09936) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09936

**Authors:** Yuxuan Tian, Zihan Wang, Yebo Peng, Aomufei Yuan, Zhiming Wang, Bairen Yi, Xin Liu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang

**Abstract:** Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.

**Comment:** The paper introduces KeepKV, a novel KV cache compression method for LLM inference, which aligns with foundational research in model compression and efficiency.

## 12. [Weight Ensembling Improves Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10478) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10478

**Authors:** Xingyu Dang, Christina Baek, Kaiyue Wen, Zico Kolter, Aditi Raghunathan

**Abstract:** We investigate a failure mode that arises during the training of reasoning models, where the diversity of generations begins to collapse, leading to suboptimal test-time scaling. Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades-off between bias and variance.

**Comment:** The paper proposes WiSE-FT, a weight ensembling method for improving reasoning in LLMs, contributing foundational insights into training dynamics and test-time scaling.

## 13. [MGS: Markov Greedy Sums for Accurate Low-Bitwidth Floating-Point Accumulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09072) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09072

**Authors:** Vikas Natesh, H. T. Kung, David Kong

**Abstract:** We offer a novel approach, MGS (Markov Greedy Sums), to improve the accuracy of low-bitwidth floating-point dot products in neural network computations. In conventional 32-bit floating-point summation, adding values with different exponents may lead to loss of precision in the mantissa of the smaller term, which is right-shifted to align with the larger term's exponent. Such shifting (a.k.a. 'swamping') is a significant source of numerical errors in accumulation when implementing low-bitwidth dot products (e.g., 8-bit floating point) as the mantissa has a small number of bits. We avoid most swamping errors by arranging the terms in dot product summation based on their exponents and summing the mantissas without overflowing the low-bitwidth accumulator. We design, analyze, and implement the algorithm to minimize 8-bit floating point error at inference time for several neural networks. In contrast to traditional sequential summation, our method has significantly lowered numerical errors, achieving classification accuracy on par with high-precision floating-point baselines for multiple image classification tasks. Our dMAC hardware units can reduce power consumption by up to 34.1\% relative to conventional MAC units.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel method for low-bitwidth floating-point accumulation, which aligns with model compression and efficiency breakthroughs.

## 14. [RouterKT: Mixture-of-Experts for Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08989) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.08989

**Authors:** Han Liao, Shuaishuai Zu

**Abstract:** Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which aims to model the dynamic knowledge states of students based on their interaction histories. However, existing KT models often rely on a global forgetting decay mechanism for capturing learning patterns, assuming that students' performance is predominantly influenced by their most recent interactions. Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex learning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning stages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous learning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns without any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay. Specifically, RouterKT introduces a \textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to effectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs \textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse patterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that RouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of various KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\% across different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, RouterKT demonstrates consistently superior inference efficiency compared to existing approaches based on handcrafted learning pattern bias, highlighting its usability for real-world educational applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/derek-liao/RouterKT.git.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for knowledge tracing, which aligns with the interest in MoE and architectural innovations.

## 15. [Sparse Hybrid Linear-Morphological Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09289) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09289

**Authors:** Konstantinos Fotopoulos, Christos Garoufis, Petros Maragos

**Abstract:** We investigate hybrid linear-morphological networks. Recent studies highlight the inherent affinity of morphological layers to pruning, but also their difficulty in training. We propose a hybrid network structure, wherein morphological layers are inserted between the linear layers of the network, in place of activation functions. We experiment with the following morphological layers: 1) maxout pooling layers (as a special case of a morphological layer), 2) fully connected dense morphological layers, and 3) a novel, sparsely initialized variant of (2). We conduct experiments on the Magna-Tag-A-Tune (music auto-tagging) and CIFAR-10 (image classification) datasets, replacing the linear classification heads of state-of-the-art convolutional network architectures with our proposed network structure for the various morphological layers. We demonstrate that these networks induce sparsity to their linear layers, making them more prunable under L1 unstructured pruning. We also show that on MTAT our proposed sparsely initialized layer achieves slightly better performance than ReLU, maxout, and densely initialized max-plus layers, and exhibits faster initial convergence.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a hybrid linear-morphological network with sparsity and pruning insights, aligning with the model compression and sparsity criteria.

## 16. [Long Context In-Context Compression by Getting to the Gist of Gisting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08934) <a id="link16"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.08934

**Authors:** Aleksandar Petrov, Mark Sandler, Andrey Zhmoginov, Nolan Miller, Max Vladymyrov

**Abstract:** Long context processing is critical for the adoption of LLMs, but existing methods often introduce architectural complexity that hinders their practical adoption. Gisting, an in-context compression method with no architectural modification to the decoder transformer, is a promising approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with existing frameworks. While effective for short instructions, we demonstrate that gisting struggles with longer contexts, with significant performance drops even at minimal compression rates. Surprisingly, a simple average pooling baseline consistently outperforms gisting. We analyze the limitations of gisting, including information flow interruptions, capacity limitations and the inability to restrict its attention to subsets of the context. Motivated by theoretical insights into the performance gap between gisting and average pooling, and supported by extensive experimentation, we propose GistPool, a new in-context compression method. GistPool preserves the simplicity of gisting, while significantly boosting its performance on long context compression tasks.

**Comment:** The paper proposes GistPool, a method for in-context compression in LLMs, which aligns with model compression and efficiency breakthroughs.

**Abstract:** The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have seen substantial advancements through deep thinking. However, these enhancements come with significant resource demands, underscoring the need to explore strategies to train effective reasoning LLMs with far fewer parameters. A critical challenge is that smaller models have different capacities and cognitive trajectories than their larger counterparts. Hence, direct distillation of chain-of-thought (CoT) results from large LLMs to smaller ones can be sometimes ineffective and requires a huge amount of annotated data. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Critique-Rethink-Verify (CRV), designed for training smaller yet powerful reasoning LLMs. Our CRV framework consists of multiple LLM agents, each specializing in unique abilities: (i) critiquing the CoTs according to the cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining these CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the refined results. We further propose the cognitive preference optimization (CogPO) algorithm to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models by aligning thoughts of these models with their cognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of CRV and CogPO, which outperforms other training methods by a large margin.

**Comment:** The CRV framework for training smaller reasoning LLMs introduces cognitive preference alignment, which is relevant to foundational research in LLM training dynamics.

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09434

**Authors:** Wenqi Fang, Chao Chen, Yongkui Yang, Zheng Wang

**Abstract:** Discovering constants of motion is meaningful in helping understand the dynamical systems, but inevitably needs proficient mathematical skills and keen analytical capabilities. With the prevalence of deep learning, methods employing neural networks, such as Constant Of Motion nETwork (COMET), are promising in handling this scientific problem. Although the COMET method can produce better predictions on dynamics by exploiting the discovered constants of motion, there is still plenty of room to sharpen it. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, built using the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) technique, and a two-phase training algorithm to improve the performance of COMET. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only retains the advantages of COMET, such as applying to non-Hamiltonian systems and indicating the number of constants of motion, but also can be more lightweight and noise-robust than COMET.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture using SVD and a two-phase training algorithm to improve the discovery of constants of motion. This aligns with foundational research in representation learning and architectural innovations.

**Abstract:** Artificial neural networks, widely recognised for their role in machine learning, are now transforming the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), bridging data-driven modelling with classical dynamical systems and enabling the development of infinitely deep neural models. However, the practical applicability of these models remains constrained by the opacity of their learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of these dynamical systems are predominantly restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce Event Transition Tensors, a framework based on high-order differentials that provides a rigorous mathematical description of neural ODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterising uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analysing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method enhances the interpretability and rigour of neural ODEs by expressing their behaviour through explicit mathematical structures. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a high-order expansion framework for neural ODEs, contributing to the theoretical understanding of neural dynamics. This aligns with foundational research in representation learning and interpretability.

**Authors:** Wenji Fang, Wenkai Li, Shang Liu, Yao Lu, Hongce Zhang, Zhiyao Xie

**Abstract:** Circuit representation learning has shown promise in advancing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) by capturing structural and functional circuit properties for various tasks. Existing pre-trained solutions rely on graph learning with complex functional supervision, such as truth table simulation. However, they only handle simple and-inverter graphs (AIGs), struggling to fully encode other complex gate functionalities. While large language models (LLMs) excel at functional understanding, they lack the structural awareness for flattened netlists. To advance netlist representation learning, we present NetTAG, a netlist foundation model that fuses gate semantics with graph structure, handling diverse gate types and supporting a variety of functional and physical tasks. Moving beyond existing graph-only methods, NetTAG formulates netlists as text-attributed graphs, with gates annotated by symbolic logic expressions and physical characteristics as text attributes. Its multimodal architecture combines an LLM-based text encoder for gate semantics and a graph transformer for global structure. Pre-trained with gate and graph self-supervised objectives and aligned with RTL and layout stages, NetTAG captures comprehensive circuit intrinsics. Experimental results show that NetTAG consistently outperforms each task-specific method on four largely different functional and physical tasks and surpasses state-of-the-art AIG encoders, demonstrating its versatility.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a multimodal netlist foundation model combining graph and text attributes, which aligns with representation learning and architectural innovations.

## 21. [Preconditioned Gradient Descent for Over-Parameterized Nonconvex Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09708) <a id="link21"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09708

**Authors:** Gavin Zhang, Salar Fattahi, Richard Y. Zhang

**Abstract:** In practical instances of nonconvex matrix factorization, the rank of the true solution $r^{\star}$ is often unknown, so the rank $r$ of the model can be overspecified as $r>r^{\star}$. This over-parameterized regime of matrix factorization significantly slows down the convergence of local search algorithms, from a linear rate with $r=r^{\star}$ to a sublinear rate when $r>r^{\star}$. We propose an inexpensive preconditioner for the matrix sensing variant of nonconvex matrix factorization that restores the convergence rate of gradient descent back to linear, even in the over-parameterized case, while also making it agnostic to possible ill-conditioning in the ground truth. Classical gradient descent in a neighborhood of the solution slows down due to the need for the model matrix factor to become singular. Our key result is that this singularity can be corrected by $\ell_{2}$ regularization with a specific range of values for the damping parameter. In fact, a good damping parameter can be inexpensively estimated from the current iterate. The resulting algorithm, which we call preconditioned gradient descent or PrecGD, is stable under noise, and converges linearly to an information theoretically optimal error bound. Our numerical experiments find that PrecGD works equally well in restoring the linear convergence of other variants of nonconvex matrix factorization in the over-parameterized regime.

**Comment:** The paper proposes PrecGD, a preconditioned gradient descent method for nonconvex matrix factorization, contributing foundational insights into optimization and efficiency in over-parameterized regimes.

## 22. [IsoSEL: Isometric Structural Entropy Learning for Deep Graph Clustering in Hyperbolic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09970) <a id="link22"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09970

**Authors:** Li Sun, Zhenhao Huang, Yujie Wang, Hongbo Lv, Chunyang Liu, Hao Peng, Philip S. Yu

**Abstract:** Graph clustering is a longstanding topic in machine learning. In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved encouraging results, but they still require predefined cluster numbers K, and typically struggle with imbalanced graphs, especially in identifying minority clusters. The limitations motivate us to study a challenging yet practical problem: deep graph clustering without K considering the imbalance in reality. We approach this problem from a fresh perspective of information theory (i.e., structural information). In the literature, structural information has rarely been touched in deep clustering, and the classic definition falls short in its discrete formulation, neglecting node attributes and exhibiting prohibitive complexity. In this paper, we first establish a new Differentiable Structural Information, generalizing the discrete formalism to continuous realm, so that the optimal partitioning tree, revealing the cluster structure, can be created by the gradient backpropagation. Theoretically, we demonstrate its capability in clustering without requiring K and identifying the minority clusters in imbalanced graphs, while reducing the time complexity to O(N) w.r.t. the number of nodes. Subsequently, we present a novel IsoSEL framework for deep graph clustering, where we design a hyperbolic neural network to learn the partitioning tree in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space, and further conduct Lorentz Tree Contrastive Learning with isometric augmentation. As a result, the partitioning tree incorporates node attributes via mutual information maximization, while the cluster assignment is refined by the proposed tree contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show the IsoSEL outperforms 14 recent baselines by an average of +1.3% in NMI.

**Comment:** The paper introduces IsoSEL, a novel framework for deep graph clustering in hyperbolic space, contributing foundational insights into representation learning and clustering methods.

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10076

**Authors:** Georgios Makrygiorgos, Joshua Hang Sai Ip, Ali Mesbah

**Abstract:** Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used method for data-driven optimization that generally relies on zeroth-order data of objective function to construct probabilistic surrogate models. These surrogates guide the exploration-exploitation process toward finding global optimum. While Gaussian processes (GPs) are commonly employed as surrogates of the unknown objective function, recent studies have highlighted the potential of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as scalable and flexible alternatives. Moreover, incorporating gradient observations into GPs, when available, has been shown to improve BO performance. However, the use of gradients within BNN surrogates remains unexplored. By leveraging automatic differentiation, gradient information can be seamlessly integrated into BNN training, resulting in more informative surrogates for BO. We propose a gradient-informed loss function for BNN training, effectively augmenting function observations with local gradient information. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on well-known benchmarks in terms of improved BNN predictions and faster BO convergence as the number of decision variables increases.

**Comment:** The paper proposes gradient-informed Bayesian neural networks for Bayesian optimization, which aligns with the 'Representation Learning' criterion by enhancing surrogate models with gradient information.

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.08912

**Authors:** Neil He, Menglin Yang, Rex Ying

**Abstract:** Hyperbolic neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling hierarchical data across diverse modalities. Recent studies show that token distributions in foundation models exhibit scale-free properties, suggesting that hyperbolic space is a more suitable ambient space than Euclidean space for many pre-training and downstream tasks. However, existing tools lack essential components for building hyperbolic foundation models, making it difficult to leverage recent advancements. We introduce HyperCore, a comprehensive open-source framework that provides core modules for constructing hyperbolic foundation models across multiple modalities. HyperCore's modules can be effortlessly combined to develop novel hyperbolic foundation models, eliminating the need to extensively modify Euclidean modules from scratch and possible redundant research efforts. To demonstrate its versatility, we build and test the first fully hyperbolic vision transformers (LViT) with a fine-tuning pipeline, the first fully hyperbolic multimodal CLIP model (L-CLIP), and a hybrid Graph RAG with a hyperbolic graph encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that LViT outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Additionally, we benchmark and reproduce experiments across hyperbolic GNNs, CNNs, Transformers, and vision Transformers to highlight HyperCore's advantages.

**Comment:** HyperCore provides a framework for building hyperbolic foundation models, aligning with architectural innovations and foundational research.

## 25. [LLM Unlearning Reveals a Stronger-Than-Expected Coreset Effect in Current Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10185) <a id="link25"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10185

**Authors:** Soumyadeep Pal, Changsheng Wang, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Sijia Liu

**Abstract:** Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/MU-Coreset.

**Comment:** The paper uncovers a coreset effect in LLM unlearning benchmarks, providing theoretical insights into how unlearning can be achieved with minimal data. This aligns with the 'Large Language Models' criterion, offering foundational insights into LLM behavior.

**Authors:** Chen Sun, Renat Aksitov, Andrey Zhmoginov, Nolan Andrew Miller, Max Vladymyrov, Ulrich Rueckert, Been Kim, Mark Sandler

**Abstract:** Large language models learn and continually learn through the accumulation of gradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affect existing knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic hallucination, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that when learning new information, LLMs exhibit a "priming" effect: learning a new fact can cause the model to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce "Outlandish," a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a ``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\% while preserving the model's ability to learn new information. Our findings provide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for improving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models.

## 27. [Negate or Embrace: On How Misalignment Shapes Multimodal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10143) <a id="link27"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10143

**Authors:** Yichao Cai, Yuhang Liu, Erdun Gao, Tianjiao Jiang, Zhen Zhang, Anton van den Hengel, Javen Qinfeng Shi

**Abstract:** Multimodal representation learning, exemplified by multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) using image-text pairs, aims to learn powerful representations by aligning cues across modalities. This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: selection bias, where some semantic variables are missing, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are distorted -- both affecting latent variables shared across modalities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of misalignment on multimodal representation learning.

**Comment:** The paper explores the impact of misalignment in multimodal representation learning, providing theoretical insights into selection and perturbation biases, which is relevant to representation learning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.08850

**Authors:** Jiaming Xu, Jiayi Pan, Yongkang Zhou, Siming Chen, Jinhao Li, Yaoxiu Lian, Junyi Wu, Guohao Dai

**Abstract:** Early exiting has recently emerged as a promising technique for accelerating large language models (LLMs) by effectively reducing the hardware computation and memory access. In this paper, we present SpecEE, a fast LLM inference engine with speculative early exiting. (1) At the algorithm level, we propose the speculation-based lightweight predictor design by exploiting the probabilistic correlation between the speculative tokens and the correct results and high parallelism of GPUs. (2) At the system level, we point out that not all layers need a predictor and design the two-level heuristic predictor scheduling engine based on skewed distribution and contextual similarity. (3) At the mapping level, we point out that different decoding methods share the same essential characteristics, and propose the context-aware merged mapping for predictor with efficient GPU implementations to support speculative decoding, and form a framework for various existing orthogonal acceleration techniques (e.g., quantization and sparse activation) on cloud and personal computer (PC) scenarios, successfully pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy and speedup. It is worth noting that SpecEE can be applied to any LLM by negligible training overhead in advance without affecting the model original parameters. Extensive experiments show that SpecEE achieves 2.25x and 2.43x speedup with Llama2-7B on cloud and PC scenarios respectively.

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10141

**Authors:** Damian Falk, Konstantin Sch\"urholt, Damian Borth

**Abstract:** Re-using trained neural network models is a common strategy to reduce training cost and transfer knowledge. Weight space learning - using the weights of trained models as data modality - is a promising new field to re-use populations of pre-trained models for future tasks. Approaches in this field have demonstrated high performance both on model analysis and weight generation tasks. However, until now their learning setup requires homogeneous model zoos where all models share the same exact architecture, limiting their capability to generalize beyond the population of models they saw during training. In this work, we remove this constraint and propose a modification to a common weight space learning method to accommodate training on heterogeneous populations of models. We further investigate the resulting impact of model diversity on generating unseen neural network model weights for zero-shot knowledge transfer. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that including models with varying underlying image datasets has a high impact on performance and generalization, for both in- and out-of-distribution settings. Code is available on github.com/HSG-AIML/MultiZoo-SANE.

## 30. [Learning from Reference Answers: Versatile Language Model Alignment without Binary Human Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09895) <a id="link30"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09895

**Authors:** Shuai Zhao, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang

**Abstract:** Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In various alignment scenarios, such as general human preference, safety, and confidence alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but necessary for human preference transferring. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function for LLM alignment. Using similarity as a reward circumvents training reward models, and collecting a single reference answer potentially costs less time than constructing binary preference pairs when multiple candidates are available. Specifically, we develop \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm, which is free of reference and reward models. Instead, RefAlign utilizes BERTScore between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as the surrogate reward. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, {RefAlign} demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods while offering high efficiency.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel alignment method for LLMs using reference answers, which could provide insights into LLM behavior and optimization.

## 31. [Towards Quantifying Commonsense Reasoning with Mechanistic Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10077) <a id="link31"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10077

**Authors:** Abhinav Joshi, Areeb Ahmad, Divyaksh Shukla, Ashutosh Modi

**Abstract:** Commonsense reasoning deals with the implicit knowledge that is well understood by humans and typically acquired via interactions with the world. In recent times, commonsense reasoning and understanding of various LLMs have been evaluated using text-based tasks. In this work, we argue that a proxy of this understanding can be maintained as a graphical structure that can further help to perform a rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning abilities about various real-world activities. We create an annotation scheme for capturing this implicit knowledge in the form of a graphical structure for 37 daily human activities. We find that the created resource can be used to frame an enormous number of commonsense queries (~ 10^{17}), facilitating rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning in LLMs. Moreover, recently, the remarkable performance of LLMs has raised questions about whether these models are truly capable of reasoning in the wild and, in general, how reasoning occurs inside these models. In this resource paper, we bridge this gap by proposing design mechanisms that facilitate research in a similar direction. Our findings suggest that the reasoning components are localized in LLMs that play a prominent role in decision-making when prompted with a commonsense query.

**Comment:** The paper explores commonsense reasoning in LLMs and proposes mechanisms for evaluating reasoning components, aligning with foundational research into LLM behavior and interpretability.

**Authors:** Mingyu Liang, Hiwot Tadese Kassa, Wenyin Fu, Brian Coutinho, Louis Feng, Christina Delimitrou

**Abstract:** Training LLMs in distributed environments presents significant challenges due to the complexity of model execution, deployment systems, and the vast space of configurable strategies. Although various optimization techniques exist, achieving high efficiency in practice remains difficult. Accurate performance models that effectively characterize and predict a model's behavior are essential for guiding optimization efforts and system-level studies. We propose Lumos, a trace-driven performance modeling and estimation toolkit for large-scale LLM training, designed to accurately capture and predict the execution behaviors of modern LLMs. We evaluate Lumos on a production ML cluster with up to 512 NVIDIA H100 GPUs using various GPT-3 variants, demonstrating that it can replay execution time with an average error of just 3.3%, along with other runtime details, across different models and configurations. Additionally, we validate its ability to estimate performance for new setups from existing traces, facilitating efficient exploration of model and deployment configurations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.09459

**Authors:** Mikael Makonnen, Moritz Vandenhirtz, Sonia Laguna, Julia E Vogt

**Abstract:** Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to enhance interpretability by structuring predictions around human-understandable concepts. However, unintended information leakage, where predictive signals bypass the concept bottleneck, compromises their transparency. This paper introduces an information-theoretic measure to quantify leakage in CBMs, capturing the extent to which concept embeddings encode additional, unintended information beyond the specified concepts. We validate the measure through controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting leakage trends across various configurations. Our findings highlight that feature and concept dimensionality significantly influence leakage, and that classifier choice impacts measurement stability, with XGBoost emerging as the most reliable estimator. Additionally, preliminary investigations indicate that the measure exhibits the anticipated behavior when applied to soft joint CBMs, suggesting its reliability in leakage quantification beyond fully synthetic settings. While this study rigorously evaluates the measure in controlled synthetic experiments, future work can extend its application to real-world datasets.

**Comment:** The paper introduces an information-theoretic measure for leakage in Concept Bottleneck Models, which aligns with representation learning by addressing how information is encoded and structured.
