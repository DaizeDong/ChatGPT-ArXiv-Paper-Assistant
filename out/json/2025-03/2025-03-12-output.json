        "abstract": "Neurons in large language models often exhibit \\emph{polysemanticity}, simultaneously encoding multiple unrelated concepts and obscuring interpretability. Instead of relying on post-hoc methods, we present \\textbf{MoE-X}, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed to be \\emph{intrinsically} interpretable. Our approach is motivated by the observation that, in language models, wider networks with sparse activations are more likely to capture interpretable factors. However, directly training such large sparse networks is computationally prohibitive. MoE architectures offer a scalable alternative by activating only a subset of experts for any given input, inherently aligning with interpretability objectives. In MoE-X, we establish this connection by rewriting the MoE layer as an equivalent sparse, large MLP. This approach enables efficient scaling of the hidden size while maintaining sparsity. To further enhance interpretability, we enforce sparse activation within each expert and redesign the routing mechanism to prioritize experts with the highest activation sparsity. These designs ensure that only the most salient features are routed and processed by the experts. We evaluate MoE-X on chess and natural language tasks, showing that it achieves performance comparable to dense models while significantly improving interpretability. MoE-X achieves a perplexity better than GPT-2, with interpretability surpassing even sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based approaches.",

        "abstract": "The quantization of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for deploying them on devices with limited computational resources. While advanced quantization algorithms offer improved performance compared to the basic linear quantization, they typically require high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), are often restricted to specific deep neural network (DNN) frameworks, and require calibration datasets. This limitation poses challenges for using such algorithms on various neural processing units (NPUs) and edge AI devices, which have diverse model formats and frameworks. In this paper, we show SplitQuantV2, an innovative algorithm designed to enhance low-bit linear quantization of LLMs, can achieve results comparable to those of advanced algorithms. SplitQuantV2 preprocesses models by splitting linear and convolution layers into functionally equivalent, quantization-friendly structures. The algorithm's platform-agnostic, concise, and efficient nature allows for implementation without the need for GPUs. Our evaluation on the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model using the AI2's Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset demonstrates that SplitQuantV2 improves the accuracy of the INT4 quantization model by 11.76%p, matching the performance of the original floating-point model. Remarkably, SplitQuantV2 took only 2 minutes 6 seconds to preprocess the 1B model and perform linear INT4 quantization using only an Apple M4 CPU. SplitQuantV2 provides a practical solution for low-bit quantization on LLMs, especially when complex, computation-intensive algorithms are inaccessible due to hardware limitations or framework incompatibilities.",

        "abstract": "Quantization has been widely used to compress and accelerate inference of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods focus on exploring the per-token dynamic calibration to ensure both inference acceleration and model accuracy under 4-bit quantization. However, in autoregressive generation inference of long sequences, the overhead of repeated dynamic quantization and dequantization steps becomes considerably expensive. In this work, we propose MergeQuant, an accurate and efficient per-channel static quantization framework. MergeQuant integrates the per-channel quantization steps with the corresponding scalings and linear mappings through a Quantization Step Migration (QSM) method, thereby eliminating the quantization overheads before and after matrix multiplication. Furthermore, in view of the significant differences between the different channel ranges, we propose dimensional reconstruction and adaptive clipping to address the non-uniformity of quantization scale factors and redistribute the channel variations to the subsequent modules to balance the parameter distribution under QSM. Within the static quantization setting of W4A4, MergeQuant reduces the accuracy gap on zero-shot tasks compared to FP16 baseline to 1.3 points on Llama-2-70B model. On Llama-2-7B model, MergeQuant achieves up to 1.77x speedup in decoding, and up to 2.06x speedup in end-to-end compared to FP16 baseline.",

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have demonstrated promise in this domain by extracting interpretable and monosemantic features.

In this paper, we introduce Route Sparse Autoencoder (RouteSAE), a new framework that integrates a routing mechanism with a shared SAE to efficiently extract features from multiple layers. It dynamically assigns weights to activations from different layers, incurring minimal parameter overhead while achieving high interpretability and flexibility for targeted feature manipulation. We evaluate RouteSAE through extensive experiments on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. Specifically, under the same sparsity constraint of 64, RouteSAE extracts 22.5% more features than baseline SAEs while achieving a 22.3% higher interpretability score. These results underscore the potential of RouteSAE as a scalable and effective method for LLM interpretability, with applications in feature discovery and model intervention.

Given this correlated latent, our method effectively separates overlapping factors without extra domain knowledge by directly minimizing the conditional mutual information between target and sensitive codes. A relevance-driven optimization strategy refines the correlated code by efficiently capturing essential correlated features and eliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAD-VAE produces fairer representations, realistic counterfactuals, and improved fairness-aware image editing.",

We introduce MoEShard, an inference system that achieves perfect load balancing through tensor sharding of MoE experts. Unlike existing approaches that rely on heuristic capacity factors or drop tokens, MoEShard evenly distributes computation across GPUs and ensures full token retention, maximizing utilization regardless of routing skewness. We achieve this through a strategic row- and column-wise decomposition of expert matrices. This reduces idle time and avoids bottlenecks caused by imbalanced expert assignments. Furthermore, MoEShard minimizes kernel launches by fusing decomposed expert computations, significantly improving throughput. We evaluate MoEShard against DeepSpeed on encoder-based architectures, demonstrating speedups of up to 6.4$\\times$ in time to first token (TTFT). Our results show that tensor sharding, when properly applied to experts, is a viable and effective strategy for efficient MoE inference.",

Finding ideal placements of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussians as our orbitals and predict their weights and covariance matrices.

The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.",

We generalize this measure to a wider class of activation functions through introduction of equivalence classes of input data, analyse its mathematical and computational properties and come up with an efficient sampling strategy for its implementation. Moreover, it has been observed that space folding values increase with network depth when the generalization error is low, but decrease when the error increases. This underpins that learned symmetries in the data manifold (e.g., invariance under reflection) become visible in terms of space folds, contributing to the network's generalization capacity. Inspired by these findings, we outline a novel regularization scheme that encourages the network to seek solutions characterized by higher folding values.",

        "title": "CIMAGE: Exploiting the Conditional Independence in Masked Graph Auto-encoders",
        "abstract": "Recent Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods encapsulating relational information via masking in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance. However, most existing approaches rely on random masking strategies in either feature or graph space, which may fail to capture task-relevant information fully. We posit that this limitation stems from an inability to achieve minimum redundancy between masked and unmasked components while ensuring maximum relevance of both to potential downstream tasks. Conditional Independence (CI) inherently satisfies the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance criteria, but its application typically requires access to downstream labels. To address this challenge, we introduce CIMAGE, a novel approach that leverages Conditional Independence to guide an effective masking strategy within the latent space. CIMAGE utilizes CI-aware latent factor decomposition to generate two distinct contexts, leveraging high-confidence pseudo-labels derived from unsupervised graph clustering. In this framework, the pretext task involves reconstructing the masked second context solely from the information provided by the first context. Our theoretical analysis further supports the superiority of CIMAGE's novel CI-aware masking method by demonstrating that the learned embedding exhibits approximate linear separability, which enables accurate predictions for the downstream task. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks illustrate the advantage of CIMAGE, with notably higher average rankings on node classification and link prediction tasks. Notably, our proposed model highlights the under-explored potential of CI in enhancing graph SSL methodologies and offers enriched insights for effective graph representation learning.",

Effectively learning a family of maps from the parameter function to the system dynamics is of great significance. In this study, we propose a novel learning framework of symbolic continuous-depth neural networks, termed Symbolic Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (SNODEs), to effectively and accurately learn the underlying dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, our learning framework comprises three stages: initially, pre-training a predefined symbolic neural network via a gradient flow matching strategy; subsequently, fine-tuning this network using Neural ODEs; and finally, constructing a general neural network to capture residuals. In this process, we apply the SNODEs framework to partial differential equation systems through Fourier analysis, achieving resolution-invariant modeling. Moreover, this framework integrates the strengths of symbolism and connectionism, boasting a universal approximation theorem while significantly enhancing interpretability and extrapolation capabilities relative to state-of-the-art baseline methods. We demonstrate this through experiments on several representative complex systems. Therefore, our framework can be further applied to a wide range of scientific problems, such as system bifurcation and control, reconstruction and forecasting, as well as the discovery of new equations.",

        "abstract": "Machine unlearning is the task of updating a trained model to forget specific training data without retraining from scratch. In this paper, we investigate how unlearning of deep neural networks (DNNs) is affected by the model parameterization level, which corresponds here to the DNN width. We define validation-based tuning for several unlearning methods from the recent literature, and show how these methods perform differently depending on (i) the DNN parameterization level, (ii) the unlearning goal (unlearned data privacy or bias removal), (iii) whether the unlearning method explicitly uses the unlearned examples. Our results show that unlearning excels on overparameterized models, in terms of balancing between generalization and achieving the unlearning goal; although for bias removal this requires the unlearning method to use the unlearned examples. We further elucidate our error-based analysis by measuring how much the unlearning changes the classification decision regions in the proximity of the unlearned examples, and avoids changing them elsewhere. By this we show that the unlearning success for overparameterized models stems from the ability to delicately change the model functionality in small regions in the input space while keeping much of the model functionality unchanged.",

We characterize the classification error achieved by ridge regression under the assumption that the covariance matrix of the cluster distribution has a high effective rank in the tail. We show that ridge regression has qualitatively different behavior depending on the scale of the cluster mean vector and its interaction with the covariance matrix of the cluster distributions. In regimes where the scale is very large, the conditions that allow for benign overfitting turn out to be the same as those for the regression task. We additionally provide insights into how the introduction of label noise affects the behavior of the minimum norm interpolator (MNI). The optimal classifier in this setting is a linear transformation of the cluster mean vector and in the noiseless setting the MNI approximately learns this transformation. On the other hand, the introduction of label noise can significantly change the geometry of the solution while preserving the same qualitative behavior.",

Our approach augments neural network backbones with a simple transformation module that maps learned discriminative features to subspaces defined using a fixed orthogonal frame. This construction naturally improves the severity of mistakes and promotes hierarchical consistency.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Hier-COS achieves state-of-the-art hierarchical performance across all the datasets while simultaneously beating top-1 accuracy in all but one case.

In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model.

Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.",

However, these methods struggled with scalability as the size of message sets and block lengths increased. TurboAE addressed this challenge by focusing on bit-sequence inputs rather than symbol-level representations, transforming the scalability issue associated with large message sets into a sequence modeling problem. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were a natural fit for sequence processing, their reliance on sequential computations made them computationally expensive and inefficient for long sequences. As a result, TurboAE adopted convolutional network blocks, which were faster to train and more scalable, but lacked the sequential modeling advantages of RNNs. Recent advances in efficient RNN architectures, such as minGRU and minLSTM, and structured state space models (SSMs) like S4 and S6, overcome these limitations by significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. These models enable scalable sequence processing, making RNNs competitive for long-sequence tasks. In this work, we revisit RNNs for Turbo autoencoders by integrating the lightweight minGRU model with a Mamba block from SSMs into a parallel Turbo autoencoder framework. Our results demonstrate that this hybrid design matches the performance of convolutional network-based Turbo autoencoder approaches for short sequences while significantly improving scalability and training efficiency for long block lengths.

        "title": "Birds look like cars: Adversarial analysis of intrinsically interpretable deep learning",
        "abstract": "A common belief is that intrinsically interpretable deep learning models ensure a correct, intuitive understanding of their behavior and offer greater robustness against accidental errors or intentional manipulation. However, these beliefs have not been comprehensively verified, and growing evidence casts doubt on them. In this paper, we highlight the risks related to overreliance and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation of these so-called \"intrinsically (aka inherently) interpretable\" models by design. We introduce two strategies for adversarial analysis with prototype manipulation and backdoor attacks against prototype-based networks, and discuss how concept bottleneck models defend against these attacks. Fooling the model's reasoning by exploiting its use of latent prototypes manifests the inherent uninterpretability of deep neural networks, leading to a false sense of security reinforced by a visual confirmation bias. The reported limitations of prototype-based networks put their trustworthiness and applicability into question, motivating further work on the robustness and alignment of (deep) interpretable models.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates approximation capabilities of two-dimensional (2D) deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with Korobov functions serving as a benchmark. We focus on 2D CNNs, comprising multi-channel convolutional layers with zero-padding and ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. We propose a fully constructive approach for building 2D CNNs to approximate Korobov functions and provide rigorous analysis of the complexity of the constructed networks. Our results demonstrate that 2D CNNs achieve near-optimal approximation rates under the continuous weight selection model, significantly alleviating the curse of dimensionality. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for 2D CNNs and illustrates their potential for broader applications in function approximation.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes median consensus embedding (MCE) to address variability in low-dimensional embeddings caused by random initialization in dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. MCE is defined as the geometric median of multiple embeddings. By assuming multiple embeddings as independent and identically distributed random samples and applying large deviation theory, we prove that MCE achieves consistency at an exponential rate. Furthermore, we develop a practical algorithm to implement MCE by constructing a distance function between embeddings based on the Frobenius norm of the pairwise distance matrix of data points. Application to real-world data demonstrates that MCE converges rapidly and significantly reduces instability. These results confirm that MCE effectively mitigates random initialization issues in embedding methods.",

In a second step we fix some remaining limitations and arrive at a novel training loss for lifted neural networks, that combines targeted and untargeted adversarial perturbations.",

        "abstract": "Modern machine learning tasks often involve massive datasets and models, necessitating distributed optimization algorithms with reduced communication overhead. Communication compression, where clients transmit compressed updates to a central server, has emerged as a key technique to mitigate communication bottlenecks. However, the theoretical understanding of stochastic distributed optimization with contractive compression remains limited, particularly in conjunction with Nesterov acceleration -- a cornerstone for achieving faster convergence in optimization.   In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, ADEF (Accelerated Distributed Error Feedback), which integrates Nesterov acceleration, contractive compression, error feedback, and gradient difference compression. We prove that ADEF achieves the first accelerated convergence rate for stochastic distributed optimization with contractive compression in the general convex regime. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of ADEF in reducing communication costs while maintaining fast convergence.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal data is a precious asset enabling a variety of downstream tasks in machine learning. However, real-world data collected across different modalities is often not paired, which is a significant challenge to learn a joint distribution. A prominent approach to address the modality coupling problem is Minimum Entropy Coupling (MEC), which seeks to minimize the joint Entropy, while satisfying constraints on the marginals. Existing approaches to the MEC problem focus on finite, discrete distributions, limiting their application for cases involving continuous data. In this work, we propose a novel method to solve the continuous MEC problem, using well-known generative diffusion models that learn to approximate and minimize the joint Entropy through a cooperative scheme, while satisfying a relaxed version of the marginal constraints. We empirically demonstrate that our method, DDMEC, is general and can be easily used to address challenging tasks, including unsupervised single-cell multi-omics data alignment and unpaired image translation, outperforming specialized methods.",
