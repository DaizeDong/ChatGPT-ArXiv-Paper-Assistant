## 2. [Dynamics of Transient Structure in In-Context Linear Regression Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17745) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2501.17745

**Authors:** Liam Carroll, Jesse Hoogland, Matthew Farrugia-Roberts, Daniel Murfet

**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks display striking examples of rich internal computational structure. Uncovering principles governing the development of such structure is a priority for the science of deep learning. In this paper, we explore the transient ridge phenomenon: when transformers are trained on in-context linear regression tasks with intermediate task diversity, they initially behave like ridge regression before specializing to the tasks in their training distribution. This transition from a general solution to a specialized solution is revealed by joint trajectory principal component analysis. Further, we draw on the theory of Bayesian internal model selection to suggest a general explanation for the phenomena of transient structure in transformers, based on an evolving tradeoff between loss and complexity. This explanation is grounded in empirical measurements of model complexity using the local learning coefficient.

**Comment:** The paper delves into the transient ridge phenomenon in transformers trained on in-context linear regression and connects this to Bayesian internal model selection. This provides theoretical insights into training dynamics and internal representations within transformers, aligning with foundational research.

## 3. [Matrix Product Sketching via Coordinated Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17836) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2501.17836

**Authors:** Majid Daliri, Juliana Freire, Danrong Li, Christopher Musco

**Abstract:** We revisit the well-studied problem of approximating a matrix product, $\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{B}$, based on small space sketches $\mathcal{S}(\mathbf{A})$ and $\mathcal{S}(\mathbf{B})$ of $\mathbf{A} \in \R^{n \times d}$ and $\mathbf{B}\in \R^{n \times m}$. We are interested in the setting where the sketches must be computed independently of each other, except for the use of a shared random seed. We prove that, when $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are sparse, methods based on \emph{coordinated random sampling} can outperform classical linear sketching approaches, like Johnson-Lindenstrauss Projection or CountSketch. For example, to obtain Frobenius norm error $\epsilon\|\mathbf{A}\|_F\|\mathbf{B}\|_F$, coordinated sampling requires sketches of size $O(s/\epsilon^2)$ when $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ have at most $s \leq d,m$ non-zeros per row. In contrast, linear sketching leads to sketches of size $O(d/\epsilon^2)$ and $O(m/\epsilon^2)$ for $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. We empirically evaluate our approach on two applications: 1) distributed linear regression in databases, a problem motivated by tasks like dataset discovery and augmentation, and 2) approximating attention matrices in transformer-based language models. In both cases, our sampling algorithms yield an order of magnitude improvement over linear sketching.

**Comment:** The paper explores a fundamental efficiency improvement in approximating matrix products using coordinated sampling over classical linear sketching. Highlights include sparse matrix efficiency and application to attention matrices in transformers, which falls under theoretical advancements in model compression.

## 4. [CardiCat: a Variational Autoencoder for High-Cardinality Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17324) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2501.17324

**Authors:** Lee Carlin, Yuval Benjamini

**Abstract:** High-cardinality categorical features are a common characteristic of mixed-type tabular datasets. Existing generative model architectures struggle to learn the complexities of such data at scale, primarily due to the difficulty of parameterizing the categorical features. In this paper, we present a general variational autoencoder model, CardiCat, that can accurately fit imbalanced high-cardinality and heterogeneous tabular data. Our method substitutes one-hot encoding with regularized dual encoder-decoder embedding layers, which are jointly learned. This approach enables us to use embeddings that depend also on the other covariates, leading to a compact and homogenized parameterization of categorical features. Our model employs a considerably smaller trainable parameter space than competing methods, enabling learning at a large scale. CardiCat generates high-quality synthetic data that better represent high-cardinality and imbalanced features compared to competing VAE models for multiple real and simulated datasets.

**Comment:** CardiCat proposes a novel variational autoencoder designed for high-cardinality tabular data, introducing architectural innovations in embeddings and parameterization. This is directly relevant to autoencoders and foundational work, particularly in representation learning and model architecture.

**Relevance:** 9
**Novelty:** 8

## 5. [Generative Unordered Flow for Set-Structured Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17770) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2501.17770

**Authors:** Yangming Li, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb

**Abstract:** Flow-based generative models have demonstrated promising performance across a broad spectrum of data modalities (e.g., image and text). However, there are few works exploring their extension to unordered data (e.g., spatial point set), which is not trivial because previous models are mostly designed for vector data that are naturally ordered. In this paper, we present unordered flow, a type of flow-based generative model for set-structured data generation. Specifically, we convert unordered data into an appropriate function representation, and learn the probability measure of such representations through function-valued flow matching. For the inverse map from a function representation to unordered data, we propose a method similar to particle filtering, with Langevin dynamics to first warm-up the initial particles and gradient-based search to update them until convergence. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, showing that our unordered flow model is very effective in generating set-structured data and significantly outperforms previous baselines.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel generative model for unordered data using flow-based techniques, contributing to model architecture by addressing set-structured data generation.

**Relevance:** 8

## 6. [A Geometric Perspective for High-Dimensional Multiplex Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17374) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2501.17374

**Authors:** Kamel Abdous, Nairouz Mrabah, Mohamed Bouguessa

**Abstract:** High-dimensional multiplex graphs are characterized by their high number of complementary and divergent dimensions. The existence of multiple hierarchical latent relations between the graph dimensions poses significant challenges to embedding methods. In particular, the geometric distortions that might occur in the representational space have been overlooked in the literature. This work studies the problem of high-dimensional multiplex graph embedding from a geometric perspective. We find that the node representations reside on highly curved manifolds, thus rendering their exploitation more challenging for downstream tasks. Moreover, our study reveals that increasing the number of graph dimensions can cause further distortions to the highly curved manifolds. To address this problem, we propose a novel multiplex graph embedding method that harnesses hierarchical dimension embedding and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks. The proposed approach hierarchically extracts hyperbolic node representations that reside on Riemannian manifolds while gradually learning fewer and more expressive latent dimensions of the multiplex graph. Experimental results on real-world high-dimensional multiplex graphs show that the synergy between hierarchical and hyperbolic embeddings incurs much fewer geometric distortions and brings notable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on downstream tasks.

**Comment:** The paper addresses the embedding of high-dimensional multiplex graphs using hierarchical and hyperbolic methods, which ties into representation learning by introducing new embedding techniques.

**Relevance:** 7
**Novelty:** 7
