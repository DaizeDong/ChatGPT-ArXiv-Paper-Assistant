The proposed approach, Mind Evolution, uses a language model to generate, recombine and refine candidate responses. The proposed approach avoids the need to formalize the underlying inference problem whenever a solution evaluator is available. Controlling for inference cost, we find that Mind Evolution significantly outperforms other inference strategies such as Best-of-N and Sequential Revision in natural language planning tasks. In the TravelPlanner and Natural Plan benchmarks, Mind Evolution solves more than 98% of the problem instances using Gemini 1.5 Pro without the use of a formal solver.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2501.10151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the advancement of information technology, the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) has fostered the integration of physical devices and social networks, deepening the study of complex interaction patterns. Text Attribute Graphs (TAGs) capture both topological structures and semantic attributes, enhancing the analysis of complex interactions within the SIoT. However, existing graph learning methods are typically designed for complete attributed graphs, and the common issue of missing attributes in Attribute Missing Graphs (AMGs) increases the difficulty of analysis tasks. To address this, we propose the Topology-Driven Attribute Recovery (TDAR) framework, which leverages topological data for AMG learning. TDAR introduces an improved pre-filling method for initial attribute recovery using native graph topology. Additionally, it dynamically adjusts propagation weights and incorporates homogeneity strategies within the embedding space to suit AMGs' unique topological structures, effectively reducing noise during information propagation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that TDAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attribute reconstruction and downstream tasks, offering a robust solution to the challenges posed by AMGs. The code is available at https://github.com/limengran98/TDAR.",
