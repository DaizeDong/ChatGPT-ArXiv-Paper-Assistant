## 1. [A Dual-Space Framework for General Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11426) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11426

**Authors:** Xue Zhang, Songming Zhang, Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Jie Zhou

**Abstract:** Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models. During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer more information. However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework exhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different output spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the student model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different vocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the distributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different prediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and dimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher and the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors with ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the student/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from different models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the distributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm to align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the above, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both off-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and surpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel dual-space knowledge distillation framework for compressing large language models, addressing key limitations in existing methods. This aligns with the 'Model Compression' criterion, particularly in sparsity and efficiency breakthroughs.

## 2. [Weight-of-Thought Reasoning: Exploring Neural Network Weights for Enhanced LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10646) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10646

**Authors:** Saif Punjwani, Larry Heck

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities when prompted with strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these approaches focus on token-level output without considering internal weight dynamics. We introduce Weight-of-Thought (WoT) reasoning, a novel approach that examines neural network weights before inference to identify reasoning pathways. Unlike existing methods, WoT explores the weight space through graph-based message passing, multi-step reasoning processes, and attention mechanisms. Our implementation creates an interconnected graph of reasoning nodes. Experiments on diverse reasoning tasks (syllogistic, mathematical, algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric) demonstrate that WoT achieves superior performance compared to traditional methods, particularly for complex problems. This approach leads to both improved performance and greater interpretability of the reasoning process, offering a promising direction for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

**Comment:** The paper introduces 'Weight-of-Thought' reasoning, a novel approach to enhance reasoning in LLMs by exploring internal weight dynamics. This aligns with the 'Large Language Models' criterion, particularly in theoretical insights into LLM behavior.

## 3. [Erzeugunsgrad, VC-Dimension and Neural Networks with rational activation function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11345) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11345

**Authors:** Luis Miguel Pardo, Daniel Sebasti\'an

**Abstract:** The notion of Erzeugungsgrad was introduced by Joos Heintz in 1983 to bound the number of non-empty cells occurring after a process of quantifier elimination. We extend this notion and the combinatorial bounds of Theorem 2 in Heintz (1983) using the degree for constructible sets defined in Pardo-Sebasti\'an (2022). We show that the Erzeugungsgrad is the key ingredient to connect affine Intersection Theory over algebraically closed fields and the VC-Theory of Computational Learning Theory for families of classifiers given by parameterized families of constructible sets. In particular, we prove that the VC-dimension and the Krull dimension are linearly related up to logarithmic factors based on Intersection Theory. Using this relation, we study the density of correct test sequences in evasive varieties. We apply these ideas to analyze parameterized families of neural networks with rational activation function.

**Comment:** This paper provides a theoretical connection between VC-dimension and neural networks with rational activation functions, which aligns with foundational research in representation learning and theoretical insights into neural networks.

## 4. [Dynamic Compressing Prompts for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11004) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11004

**Authors:** Jinwu Hu, Wei Zhang, Yufeng Wang, Yu Hu, Bin Xiao, Mingkui Tan, Qing Du

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across a variety of tasks, partly due to advanced prompting techniques. However, these techniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs and can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs. While prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods confront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context changes, and remaining effective across different tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts (LLM-DCP). Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to preserve the performance as much as possible. We model prompt compression as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove redundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content. We develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the compression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key information. This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external black-box LLM. Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum learning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training strategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the DCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information integrity. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially at higher compression rates. The code for our approach will be available at https://github.com/Fhujinwu/DCP.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a method for dynamic prompt compression in LLMs, which aligns with model compression and efficiency breakthroughs. The use of a Markov Decision Process and hierarchical training strategy adds novelty.

## 5. [When is Task Vector Provably Effective for Model Editing? A Generalization Analysis of Nonlinear Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10957) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10957

**Authors:** Hongkang Li, Yihua Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Meng Wang, Sijia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen

**Abstract:** Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).

**Comment:** This paper provides theoretical insights into task vector arithmetic for model editing, particularly in nonlinear Transformers. It aligns with foundational research in representation learning and model architecture, offering a novel theoretical perspective.

## 6. [Looking beyond the next token](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11336) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11336

**Authors:** Abitha Thankaraj, Yiding Jiang, J. Zico Kolter, Yonatan Bisk

**Abstract:** The structure of causal language model training assumes that each token can be accurately predicted from the previous context. This contrasts with humans' natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before the exact argument or phrasings. While this mismatch has been well studied in the literature, the working assumption has been that architectural changes are needed to address this mismatch. We argue that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, our method naturally enables the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost. We investigate how using the model's goal-generation capability can further improve planning and reasoning. Additionally, we believe Trelawney could potentially open doors to new capabilities beyond the current language modeling paradigm.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a data rearrangement technique, Trelawney, to address the mismatch in causal language model training. It aligns with foundational research in LLMs and offers a novel perspective on training dynamics.

## 7. [Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11320) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11320

**Authors:** Ruicheng Ao, Gan Luo, David Simchi-Levi, Xinshang Wang

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are indispensable in today's applications, but their inference procedure -- generating responses by processing text in segments and using a memory-heavy Key-Value (KV) cache -- demands significant computational resources, particularly under memory constraints. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi. This work bridges operations research and machine learning, offering a rigorous framework for the efficient deployment of LLMs under memory constraints.

**Comment:** The paper focuses on optimizing LLM inference with memory constraints, introducing a novel scheduling algorithm (WAIT) and theoretical analysis. This aligns with the 'Model Compression' criterion, particularly in the context of KV cache efficiency.

## 8. [Leveraging Submodule Linearity Enhances Task Arithmetic Performance in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10902) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10902

**Authors:** Rui Dai, Sile Hu, Xu Shen, Yonggang Zhang, Xinmei Tian, Jieping Ye

**Abstract:** Task arithmetic is a straightforward yet highly effective strategy for model merging, enabling the resultant model to exhibit multi-task capabilities. Recent research indicates that models demonstrating linearity enhance the performance of task arithmetic. In contrast to existing methods that rely on the global linearization of the model, we argue that this linearity already exists within the model's submodules. In particular, we present a statistical analysis and show that submodules (e.g., layers, self-attentions, and MLPs) exhibit significantly higher linearity than the overall model. Based on these findings, we propose an innovative model merging strategy that independently merges these submodules. Especially, we derive a closed-form solution for optimal merging weights grounded in the linear properties of these submodules. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the standard task arithmetic approach and other established baselines across different model scales and various tasks. This result highlights the benefits of leveraging the linearity of submodules and provides a new perspective for exploring solutions for effective and practical multi-task model merging.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel model merging strategy leveraging submodule linearity, which aligns with foundational research in model architecture and representation learning. The closed-form solution for merging weights is a notable theoretical contribution.

## 9. [Cryo-em images are intrinsically low dimensional](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11249) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11249

**Authors:** Luke Evans, Octavian-Vlad Murad, Lars Dingeldein, Pilar Cossio, Roberto Covino, Marina Meila

**Abstract:** Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.

**Comment:** The paper investigates the low-dimensional structure of cryo-EM latent spaces, providing insights into representation learning and manifold geometry. This aligns with 'Representation Learning' and foundational research in AI for Science.

## 10. [MiMu: Mitigating Multiple Shortcut Learning Behavior of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10551) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10551

**Authors:** Lili Zhao, Qi Liu, Wei Chen, Liyi Chen, Ruijun Sun, Min Hou, Yang Wang, Shijin Wang

**Abstract:** Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) models often rely on spurious correlations between features and labels during the learning process, leading to shortcut learning behavior that undermines robustness generalization performance. Current research mainly targets identifying or mitigating a single shortcut; however, in real-world scenarios, cues within the data are diverse and unknown. In empirical studies, we reveal that the models rely to varying extents on different shortcuts. Compared to weak shortcuts, models depend more heavily on strong shortcuts, resulting in their poor generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose MiMu, a novel method integrated with Transformer-based ERMs designed to Mitigate Multiple shortcut learning behavior, which incorporates self-calibration strategy and self-improvement strategy. In the source model, we preliminarily propose the self-calibration strategy to prevent the model from relying on shortcuts and make overconfident predictions. Then, we further design self-improvement strategy in target model to reduce the reliance on multiple shortcuts. The random mask strategy involves randomly masking partial attention positions to diversify the focus of target model other than concentrating on a fixed region. Meanwhile, the adaptive attention alignment module facilitates the alignment of attention weights to the calibrated source model, without the need for post-hoc attention maps or supervision. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) demonstrate the effectiveness of MiMu in improving robustness generalization abilities.

**Comment:** The paper addresses shortcut learning in Transformers and proposes strategies to mitigate it, which aligns with foundational research in model architecture and training dynamics.

## 11. [Single-Input Multi-Output Model Merging: Leveraging Foundation Models for Dense Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11268) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11268

**Authors:** Juan Garcia Giraldo, Nikolaos Dimitriadis, Ke Wang, Pascal Frossard

**Abstract:** Model merging is a flexible and computationally tractable approach to merge single-task checkpoints into a multi-task model. Prior work has solely focused on constrained multi-task settings where there is a one-to-one mapping between a sample and a task, overlooking the paradigm where multiple tasks may operate on the same sample, e.g., scene understanding. In this paper, we focus on the multi-task setting with single-input-multiple-outputs (SIMO) and show that it qualitatively differs from the single-input-single-output model merging settings studied in the literature due to the existence of task-specific decoders and diverse loss objectives. We identify that existing model merging methods lead to significant performance degradation, primarily due to representation misalignment between the merged encoder and task-specific decoders. We propose two simple and efficient fixes for the SIMO setting to re-align the feature representation after merging. Compared to joint fine-tuning, our approach is computationally effective and flexible, and sheds light into identifying task relationships in an offline manner. Experiments on NYUv2, Cityscapes, and a subset of the Taskonomy dataset demonstrate: (1) task arithmetic suffices to enable multi-task capabilities; however, the representations generated by the merged encoder has to be re-aligned with the task-specific heads; (2) the proposed architecture rivals traditional multi-task learning in performance but requires fewer samples and training steps by leveraging the existence of task-specific models.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel approach to model merging in multi-task learning, which aligns with representation learning and architectural insights. The focus on task-specific decoders and representation alignment is relevant.

## 12. [VEXP: A Low-Cost RISC-V ISA Extension for Accelerated Softmax Computation in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11227) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11227

**Authors:** Run Wang, Gamze Islamoglu, Andrea Belano, Viviane Potocnik, Francesco Conti, Angelo Garofalo, Luca Benini

**Abstract:** While Transformers are dominated by Floating-Point (FP) Matrix-Multiplications, their aggressive acceleration through dedicated hardware or many-core programmable systems has shifted the performance bottleneck to non-linear functions like Softmax. Accelerating Softmax is challenging due to its non-pointwise, non-linear nature, with exponentiation as the most demanding step. To address this, we design a custom arithmetic block for Bfloat16 exponentiation leveraging a novel approximation algorithm based on Schraudolph's method, and we integrate it into the Floating-Point Unit (FPU) of the RISC-V cores of a compute cluster, through custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions, with a negligible area overhead of 1\%. By optimizing the software kernels to leverage the extension, we execute Softmax with 162.7$\times$ less latency and 74.3$\times$ less energy compared to the baseline cluster, achieving an 8.2$\times$ performance improvement and 4.1$\times$ higher energy efficiency for the FlashAttention-2 kernel in GPT-2 configuration. Moreover, the proposed approach enables a multi-cluster system to efficiently execute end-to-end inference of pre-trained Transformer models, such as GPT-2, GPT-3 and ViT, achieving up to 5.8$\times$ and 3.6$\times$ reduction in latency and energy consumption, respectively, without requiring re-training and with negligible accuracy loss.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a hardware-level optimization for Softmax computation in Transformers, which aligns with model efficiency and architectural innovations. The integration into RISC-V cores and performance improvements are notable.

## 13. [Better Estimation of the KL Divergence Between Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10637) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.10637

**Authors:** Afra Amini, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell

**Abstract:** Estimating the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between language models has many applications, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), interpretability, and knowledge distillation. However, computing the exact KL divergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus, practitioners often resort to the use of sampling-based estimators. While it is easy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator notoriously suffers from high variance, and can even result in a negative estimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we introduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is also unbiased and provably has variance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In an empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially in practice. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator of the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and produces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward vs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a Rao-Blackwellized estimator for KL divergence, addressing variance issues in sampling-based estimators. This aligns with 'Representation Learning' and theoretical advancements in LLM behavior.

## 14. [Elucidating the Design Space of Multimodal Protein Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11454) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11454

**Authors:** Cheng-Yen (Wesley), Hsieh, Xinyou Wang, Daiheng Zhang, Dongyu Xue, Fei Ye, Shujian Huang, Zaixiang Zheng, Quanquan Gu

**Abstract:** Multimodal protein language models (PLMs) integrate sequence and token-based structural information, serving as a powerful foundation for protein modeling, generation, and design. However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into discrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained structural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate the design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify tokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as major bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved generative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning, and data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision, demonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural modeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure generation diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by reducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B baselines and on par with the specialized folding models.

**Comment:** The paper systematically explores the design space of multimodal protein language models, addressing tokenization loss and structural modeling. It aligns with foundational research in AI for science, particularly in protein modeling.

## 15. [MLPs and KANs for data-driven learning in physical problems: A performance comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11397) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2504.11397

**Authors:** Raghav Pant, Sikan Li, Xingjian Li, Hassan Iqbal, Krishna Kumar

**Abstract:** There is increasing interest in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by casting them as machine learning problems. Recently, there has been a spike in exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional neural networks represented by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While showing promise, their performance advantages in physics-based problems remain largely unexplored. Several critical questions persist: Can KANs capture complex physical dynamics and under what conditions might they outperform traditional architectures? In this work, we present a comparative study of KANs and MLPs for learning physical systems governed by PDEs. We assess their performance when applied in deep operator networks (DeepONet) and graph network-based simulators (GNS), and test them on physical problems that vary significantly in scale and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the Kolmogorov Representation Theorem, we examine the behavior of KANs and MLPs across shallow and deep network architectures. Our results reveal that although KANs do not consistently outperform MLPs when configured as deep neural networks, they demonstrate superior expressiveness in shallow network settings, significantly outpacing MLPs in accuracy over our test cases. This suggests that KANs are a promising choice, offering a balance of efficiency and accuracy in applications involving physical systems.

**Comment:** The paper compares KANs and MLPs for solving PDEs, providing insights into their expressiveness and performance. This aligns with foundational research in representation learning and model architecture, particularly in physics-informed machine learning.

## Relevant Topics

Use the following relevance criteria to focus on foundational research. Keep **relevant** papers and filter out **irrelevant** ones. Avoid purely **application-driven** work.

1. Representation Learning
   - Relevant: Insights into how deep networks encode information, feature/dictionary learning, sparse/contrastive methods, training dynamics in neural networks.
   - Irrelevant: Standard applications of known techniques lacking new theoretical or methodological contributions.

2. Model Architecture
   - Relevant: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Transformers, Conditional/Dynamic Networks, Autoencoders, analysis on existing architectures (like encoder-decoder), or other architectural innovations.
   - Irrelevant: Merely using existing architectures for a certain task without insights into the structure themselves.

3. Model Compression
   - Relevant: Sparsity, pruning, quantization, low-rank approaches, KV cache, or other algorithmic/theoretical efficiency breakthroughs.
   - Irrelevant: Straightforward applications of existing compression methods to new tasks.

4. Large Language Models (LLMs)
   - Relevant: Major breakthroughs in pretraining or architecture, theoretical insights into LLM behavior/interpretability.
   - Irrelevant: Domain-specific usage (e.g., translation, jail-breaking), finetuning or inference tricks (e.g., instruction tuning, chain-of-thoughts, data mixing), or empirical dataset/benchmark studies and text-level analysis (e.g. hallucination, reasoning, safety).

5. AI for Science
   - Relevant: Foundational research in molecular/protein modeling, new generative paradigms, or significant architecture-level innovations.
   - Irrelevant: Conventional, domain-specific applications without new theoretical perspectives.

6. Emerging Trends
   - Relevant: Cutting-edge theoretical work challenging established assumptions or introducing broad new paradigms.
   - Irrelevant: Incremental improvements or trend-following without novel insights.
