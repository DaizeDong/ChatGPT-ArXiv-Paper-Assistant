## 1. [Torsional-GFN: a conditional conformation generator for small molecules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11759) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11759

**Authors:** Alexandra Volokhova, L\'ena N\'ehale Ezzine, Piotr Gai\'nski, Luca Scimeca, Emmanuel Bengio, Prudencio Tossou, Yoshua Bengio, Alex Hernandez-Garcia

**Abstract:** Generating stable molecular conformations is crucial in several drug discovery applications, such as estimating the binding affinity of a molecule to a target. Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution, using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local structure into the GFlowNet model.

## 2. [Cluster Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12359) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12359

**Authors:** Nikolaos Giakoumoglou, Tania Stathaki

**Abstract:** We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements, CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18 backbone. By integrating contrastive learning with clustering, CueCo sets a new direction for advancing unsupervised visual representation learning.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel approach to unsupervised visual representation learning by combining contrastive learning and clustering, aligning with the representation learning criterion.

## 3. [SToFM: a Multi-scale Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11588) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11588

**Authors:** Suyuan Zhao, Yizhen Luo, Ganbo Yang, Yan Zhong, Hao Zhou, Zaiqing Nie

**Abstract:** Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data

**Comment:** The paper introduces a multi-scale foundation model for spatial transcriptomics, which is relevant to AI for science and foundational model research.

## 4. [Mixture of Raytraced Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12419) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12419

**Authors:** Andrea Perin, Giacomo Lagomarsini, Claudio Gallicchio, Giuseppe Nuti

**Abstract:** We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the design of potentially faster and more expressive models. The code is available at https://github.com/nutig/RayTracing

**Comment:** The paper introduces a Mixture of Experts architecture with dynamic expert selection, directly relevant to model architecture innovations.

## 5. [Tracing the Path to Grokking: Embeddings, Dropout, and Network Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11645) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11645

**Authors:** Ahmed Salah, David Yevick

**Abstract:** Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally, the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries. These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and behaviour of grokking.

**Comment:** The paper provides insights into neural network training dynamics and introduces metrics related to sparsity and embedding similarity, which are relevant to representation learning.

## 6. [PoTPTQ: A Two-step Power-of-Two Post-training for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11959) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11959

**Authors:** Xinyu Wang, Vahid Partovi Nia, Peng Lu, Jerry Huang, Xiao-Wen Chang, Boxing Chen, Yufei Cui

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is challenging due to the substantial computational resources required. Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i) initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii) refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and $1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel quantization framework for LLMs, focusing on efficiency and compression, which aligns with model compression criteria.

## 7. [Composing Linear Layers from Irreducibles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11688) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11688

**Authors:** Travis Pence, Daisuke Yamada, Vikas Singh

**Abstract:** Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into higher-level functions within deep models.

**Comment:** The paper explores the compositional structure of linear layers using geometric primitives, which aligns with foundational research in model architecture and representation learning.

## 8. [Your LLM Knows the Future: Uncovering Its Multi-Token Prediction Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11851) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11851

**Authors:** Mohammad Samragh, Arnav Kundu, David Harrison, Kumari Nishu, Devang Naik, Minsik Cho, Mehrdad Farajtabar

**Abstract:** Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any loss in quality.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel framework for multi-token prediction in LLMs, which aligns with large language models by proposing a new method for improving inference speed.

## 9. [IAM: Efficient Inference through Attention Mapping between Different-scale LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11953) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11953

**Authors:** Yi Zhao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Abstract:** LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays, especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs, which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

**Comment:** The paper introduces the IAM framework for efficient inference in LLMs, which aligns with model compression by proposing a method to reduce resource consumption and improve efficiency.

## 10. [Optimizers Qualitatively Alter Solutions And We Should Leverage This](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12224) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12224

**Authors:** Razvan Pascanu, Clare Lyle, Ionut-Vlad Modoranu, Naima Elosegui Borras, Dan Alistarh, Petar Velickovic, Sarath Chandar, Soham De, James Martens

**Abstract:** Due to the nonlinear nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), one can not guarantee convergence to a unique global minimum of the loss when using optimizers relying only on local information, such as SGD. Indeed, this was a primary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early days of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed this skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows that sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit well-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This success has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model for learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of required iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We argue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another perspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the optimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative properties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will encode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class of models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of encoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community should aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as aim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain properties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their convergence rates. We hope our arguments will inspire research to improve our understanding of how the learning process can impact the type of solution we converge to, and lead to a greater recognition of optimizers design as a critical lever that complements the roles of architecture and data in shaping model outcomes.

**Comment:** The paper discusses the role of optimizers in influencing the qualitative properties of learned solutions, which is relevant to understanding training dynamics in neural networks.

## 11. [FactorHD: A Hyperdimensional Computing Model for Multi-Object Multi-Class Representation and Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12366) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12366

**Authors:** Yifei Zhou, Xuchu Huang, Chenyu Ni, Min Zhou, Zheyu Yan, Xunzhao Yin, Cheng Zhuo

**Abstract:** Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation, where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses, they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently. FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class. Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation, overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network, FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel HDC model for efficient representation and factorization, which is relevant to emerging trends in neuro-symbolic AI.

## 12. [Einstein Fields: A Neural Perspective To Computational General Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11589) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11589

**Authors:** Sandeep Suresh Cranganore, Andrei Bodnar, Arturs Berzins, Johannes Brandstetter

**Abstract:** We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the \emph{metric}, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are \emph{Neural Tensor Fields} with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential, including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive approaches to numerical relativity. Code is made available at https://github.com/AndreiB137/EinFields

**Comment:** The paper introduces a neural representation for computational general relativity, which is relevant to AI for Science with a focus on foundational research.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11895

**Authors:** Haolin Zou, Arnab Auddy, Yongchan Kwon, Kamiar Rahnama Rad, Arian Maleki

**Abstract:** The increasing complexity of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models has created a pressing need for tools that help scientists, engineers, and policymakers interpret and refine model decisions and predictions. Influence functions, originating from robust statistics, have emerged as a popular approach for this purpose.   However, the heuristic foundations of influence functions rely on low-dimensional assumptions where the number of parameters $p$ is much smaller than the number of observations $n$. In contrast, modern AI models often operate in high-dimensional regimes with large $p$, challenging these assumptions.   In this paper, we examine the accuracy of influence functions in high-dimensional settings. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that influence functions cannot reliably fulfill their intended purpose. We then introduce an alternative approximation, called Newfluence, that maintains similar computational efficiency while offering significantly improved accuracy.   Newfluence is expected to provide more accurate insights than many existing methods for interpreting complex AI models and diagnosing their issues. Moreover, the high-dimensional framework we develop in this paper can also be applied to analyze other popular techniques, such as Shapley values.

**Comment:** The paper introduces Newfluence, an alternative to influence functions for model interpretability in high dimensions, which is relevant to representation learning.

## 14. [Incorporating Fairness Constraints into Archetypal Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12021) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12021

**Authors:** Aleix Alcacer, Irene Epifanio

**Abstract:** Archetypal Analysis (AA) is an unsupervised learning method that represents data as convex combinations of extreme patterns called archetypes. While AA provides interpretable and low-dimensional representations, it can inadvertently encode sensitive attributes, leading to fairness concerns. In this work, we propose Fair Archetypal Analysis (FairAA), a modified formulation that explicitly reduces the influence of sensitive group information in the learned projections. We also introduce FairKernelAA, a nonlinear extension that addresses fairness in more complex data distributions. Our approach incorporates a fairness regularization term while preserving the structure and interpretability of the archetypes. We evaluate FairAA and FairKernelAA on synthetic datasets, including linear, nonlinear, and multi-group scenarios, demonstrating their ability to reduce group separability -- as measured by mean maximum discrepancy and linear separability -- without substantially compromising explained variance. We further validate our methods on the real-world ANSUR I dataset, confirming their robustness and practical utility. The results show that FairAA achieves a favorable trade-off between utility and fairness, making it a promising tool for responsible representation learning in sensitive applications.

**Comment:** The paper focuses on representation learning by proposing Fair Archetypal Analysis, which modifies Archetypal Analysis to incorporate fairness constraints, aligning with the representation learning criterion.

## 15. [An Memory-Efficient Framework for Deformable Transformer with Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11549) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11549

**Authors:** Wendong Mao, Mingfan Zhao, Jianfeng Guan, Qiwei Dong, Zhongfeng Wang

**Abstract:** Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions. However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2% accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with existing DAT acceleration methods.

**Comment:** The paper focuses on optimizing Deformable Attention Transformers for hardware efficiency, which aligns with model compression and efficiency breakthroughs.

**Authors:** Andrei Rekesh, Miruna Cretu, Dmytro Shevchuk, Vignesh Ram Somnath, Pietro Li\`o, Robert A. Batey, Mike Tyers, Micha{\l} Koziarski, Cheng-Hao Liu

**Abstract:** Ensuring synthesizability in generative small molecule design remains a major challenge. While recent developments in synthesizable molecule generation have demonstrated promising results, these efforts have been largely confined to 2D molecular graph representations, limiting the ability to perform geometry-based conditional generation. In this work, we present SynCoGen (Synthesizable Co-Generation), a single framework that combines simultaneous masked graph diffusion and flow matching for synthesizable 3D molecule generation. SynCoGen samples from the joint distribution of molecular building blocks, chemical reactions, and atomic coordinates. To train the model, we curated SynSpace, a dataset containing over 600K synthesis-aware building block graphs and 3.3M conformers. SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand generation in drug discovery. Overall, this multimodal formulation represents a foundation for future applications enabled by non-autoregressive molecular generation, including analog expansion, lead optimization, and direct structure conditioning.

**Comment:** The paper presents a framework for synthesizable 3D molecule generation, which is relevant to foundational research in AI for Science, particularly in molecular modeling.

## 17. [RiemannLoRA: A Unified Riemannian Framework for Ambiguity-Free LoRA Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12142) <a id="link17"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12142

**Authors:** Vladimir Bogachev, Vladimir Aletov, Alexander Molozhavenko, Denis Bobkov, Vera Soboleva, Aibek Alanov, Maxim Rakhuba

**Abstract:** Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain, including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a Riemannian framework for LoRA optimization, which is relevant to model compression and efficiency.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11807

**Authors:** Ruofan Hu, Dongyu Zhang, Huayi Zhang, Elke Rundensteiner

**Abstract:** Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset, which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU). CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training. Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at https://github.com/ruofanhu/CLID-MU.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel meta-learning strategy for learning with noisy labels, which is a foundational aspect of representation learning.

## 19. [Effective Fine-Tuning of Vision Transformers with Low-Rank Adaptation for Privacy-Preserving Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11943) <a id="link19"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11943

**Authors:** Haiwei Lin, Shoko Imaizumi, Hitoshi Kiya

**Abstract:** We propose a low-rank adaptation method for training privacy-preserving vision transformer (ViT) models that efficiently freezes pre-trained ViT model weights. In the proposed method, trainable rank decomposition matrices are injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch embedding layer is not frozen, unlike in the case of the conventional low-rank adaptation methods. The proposed method allows us not only to reduce the number of trainable parameters but to also maintain almost the same accuracy as that of full-time tuning.

**Comment:** The paper discusses low-rank adaptation for vision transformers, which is relevant to model compression and efficiency.

## 20. [Sparse Autoencoders for Sequential Recommendation Models: Interpretation and Flexible Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12202) <a id="link20"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12202

**Authors:** Anton Klenitskiy, Konstantin Polev, Daria Denisova, Alexey Vasilev, Dmitry Simakov, Gleb Gusev

**Abstract:** Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.   This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior, providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.

**Comment:** The paper applies sparse autoencoders to sequential recommendation models, focusing on interpretability and control, which is relevant to representation learning.

## 21. [Protenix-Mini: Efficient Structure Predictor via Compact Architecture, Few-Step Diffusion and Switchable pLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11839) <a id="link21"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11839

**Authors:** Chengyue Gong, Xinshi Chen, Yuxuan Zhang, Yuxuan Song, Hao Zhou, Wenzhi Xiao

**Abstract:** Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and other downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. In this work, we address the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process, Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.

**Comment:** The paper presents a compact architecture for protein structure prediction, focusing on model efficiency and architectural pruning, which aligns with model compression and architecture innovation.

## 22. [Enforcing Latent Euclidean Geometry in Single-Cell VAEs for Manifold Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11789) <a id="link22"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.11789

**Authors:** Alessandro Palma, Sergei Rybakov, Leon Hetzel, Stephan G\"unnemann, Fabian J. Theis

**Abstract:** Latent space interpolations are a powerful tool for navigating deep generative models in applied settings. An example is single-cell RNA sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry. Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel training framework for VAEs to enforce Euclidean geometry in latent spaces, which is relevant to representation learning and model architecture.

## 23. [CytoSAE: Interpretable Cell Embeddings for Hematology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12464) <a id="link23"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12464

**Authors:** Muhammed Furkan Dasdelen, Hyesu Lim, Michele Buck, Katharina S. G\"otze, Carsten Marr, Steffen Schneider

**Abstract:** Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model. While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at https://github.com/dynamical-inference/cytosae.

## 24. [Probing for Arithmetic Errors in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12379) <a id="link24"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12379

**Authors:** Yucheng Sun, Alessandro Stolfo, Mrinmaya Sachan

**Abstract:** We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

**Comment:** The paper investigates internal activations in language models to detect arithmetic errors, which aligns with representation learning by exploring how models encode information.
