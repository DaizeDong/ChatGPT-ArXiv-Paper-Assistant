        "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, there is a growing demand for efficient inference on memory-constrained devices. While offloading expert parameters to CPU memory and loading activated experts on demand has emerged as a potential solution, the large size of activated experts overburdens the limited PCIe bandwidth, hindering the effectiveness in latency-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this, we propose FloE, an on-the-fly MoE inference system on memory-constrained GPUs. FloE is built on the insight that there exists substantial untapped redundancy within sparsely activated experts. It employs various compression techniques on the expert's internal parameter matrices to reduce the data movement load, combined with low-cost sparse prediction, achieving perceptible inference acceleration in wall-clock time on resource-constrained devices. Empirically, FloE achieves a 9.3x compression of parameters per expert in Mixtral-8x7B; enables deployment on a GPU with only 11GB VRAM, reducing the memory footprint by up to 8.5x; and delivers a 48.7x inference speedup compared to DeepSpeed-MII on a single GeForce RTX 3090.",

        "abstract": "Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where the timing and interplay between neurons is critical to how brains process information. Most deep learning architectures simplify neural activity by abstracting away temporal dynamics. In this paper we challenge that paradigm. By incorporating neuron-level processing and synchronization, we can effectively reintroduce neural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core representation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a history of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a latent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between oversimplified neuron abstractions that improve computational efficiency, and biological realism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures essential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for deep learning. We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a range of challenging tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, solving 2D mazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks. Beyond displaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for interpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks that require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive compute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when faced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the CTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new state-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a significant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful artificial intelligence systems.",

However, downstream probing primarily assesses the availability of task-relevant information in the model's latent space, overlooking attributes such as equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement, which contribute to the interpretability, adaptability, and utility of representations in real-world applications. While some attempts have been made to measure these qualities in representations, no unified evaluation framework with modular, generalizable, and interpretable metrics exists.   In this paper, we argue for the importance of representation evaluation beyond downstream probing. We introduce a standardized protocol to quantify informativeness, equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement of factors of variation in model representations. We use it to evaluate representations from a variety of models in the image and speech domains using different architectures and pretraining approaches on identified controllable factors of variation. We find that representations from models with similar downstream performance can behave substantially differently with regard to these attributes. This hints that the respective mechanisms underlying their downstream performance are functionally different, prompting new research directions to understand and improve representations.",

However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective similarity objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 20 existing approaches across both homophily and heterophily graphs, validating the effectiveness of leveraging natural relative similarity over artificial absolute similarity.",

        "abstract": "Transformer-based models are the foundation of modern machine learning, but their execution, particularly during autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs), places significant pressure on memory systems due to frequent memory accesses and growing key-value (KV) caches. This creates a bottleneck in memory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth and compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily optimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access patterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they suffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization. In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme tailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC clusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed centroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without frequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM system show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces attention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a KV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and 45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC maintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and hardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.",

We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian on our induced symmetric simplicial set reduces exactly to the traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs, validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory. Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of Neural Sheaf Diffusion (NSD) to hypergraphs.

        "abstract": "Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one ``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs, we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text infilling.",

        "title": "Griffin: Towards a Graph-Centric Relational Database Foundation Model",
        "abstract": "We introduce Griffin, the first foundation model attemptation designed specifically for Relational Databases (RDBs). Unlike previous smaller models focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.

        "title": "Autoencoder-Based Hybrid Replay for Class-Incremental Learning",
        "abstract": "In class-incremental learning (CIL), effective incremental learning strategies are essential to mitigate task confusion and catastrophic forgetting, especially as the number of tasks $t$ increases. Current exemplar replay strategies impose $\\mathcal{O}(t)$ memory/compute complexities. We propose an autoencoder-based hybrid replay (AHR) strategy that leverages our new hybrid autoencoder (HAE) to function as a compressor to alleviate the requirement for large memory, achieving $\\mathcal{O}(0.1 t)$ at the worst case with the computing complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(t)$ while accomplishing state-of-the-art performance. The decoder later recovers the exemplar data stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same memory/compute budgets. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon publication.",

        "abstract": "Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for automatically discovering mathematical expressions from input data. Mainstream SR algorithms search for the optimal symbolic tree in a vast function space, but the increasing complexity of the tree structure limits their performance. Inspired by neural networks, symbolic networks have emerged as a promising new paradigm. However, most existing symbolic networks still face certain challenges: binary nonlinear operators $\\{\\times, \\div\\}$ cannot be naturally extended to multivariate operators, and training with fixed architecture often leads to higher complexity and overfitting. In this work, we propose a Unified Symbolic Network that unifies nonlinear binary operators into nested unary operators and define the conditions under which UniSymNet can reduce complexity. Moreover, we pre-train a Transformer model with a novel label encoding method to guide structural selection, and adopt objective-specific optimization strategies to learn the parameters of the symbolic network. UniSymNet shows high fitting accuracy, excellent symbolic solution rate, and relatively low expression complexity, achieving competitive performance on low-dimensional Standard Benchmarks and high-dimensional SRBench.",

        "abstract": "Recent work has shown that the attention maps of the widely popular DINOv2 model exhibit artifacts, which hurt both model interpretability and performance on dense image tasks. These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch tokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image information. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been incorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading to a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings, we show that the CLS token itself, which can be interpreted as a register, leads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens. Our work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of large ViTs. Further, by clearly attributing the faulty behaviour to register and CLS tokens, we show a path towards more interpretable vision models.",
