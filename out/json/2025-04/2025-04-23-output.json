        "abstract": "For a controllable linear time-varying (LTV) pair $(\\boldsymbol{A}_t,\\boldsymbol{B}_t)$ and $\\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}$ positive semidefinite, we derive the Markov kernel for the It\\^{o} diffusion ${\\mathrm{d}}\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}=\\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\\boldsymbol{x}_t {\\mathrm{d}} t + \\sqrt{2}\\boldsymbol{B}_{t}{\\mathrm{d}}\\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ with an accompanying killing of probability mass at rate $\\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}\\boldsymbol{x}$. This Markov kernel is the Green's function for an associated linear reaction-advection-diffusion partial differential equation. Our result generalizes the recently derived kernel for the special case $\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_t,\\boldsymbol{B}_t\\right)=\\left(\\boldsymbol{0},\\boldsymbol{I}\\right)$, and depends on the solution of an associated Riccati matrix ODE. A consequence of this result is that the linear quadratic non-Gaussian Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge is exactly solvable. This means that the problem of steering a controlled LTV diffusion from a given non-Gaussian distribution to another over a fixed deadline while minimizing an expected quadratic cost can be solved using dynamic Sinkhorn recursions performed with the derived kernel. Our derivation for the $\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_t,\\boldsymbol{B}_t,\\boldsymbol{Q}_t\\right)$-parametrized kernel pursues a new idea that relies on finding a state-time dependent distance-like functional given by the solution of a deterministic optimal control problem. This technique breaks away from existing methods, such as generalizing Hermite polynomials or Weyl calculus, which have seen limited success in the reaction-diffusion context. Our technique uncovers a new connection between Markov kernels, distances, and optimal control. This connection is of interest beyond its immediate application in solving the linear quadratic Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge problem.",

This leads to our key insight: self-attention is able to approximate a generalized version of ReLU to arbitrary precision, and hence subsumes many known universal approximators.

In contrast, prior works rely on feed-forward networks to establish universal approximation in Transformers.

        "abstract": "State space models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to Transformer models for language modeling, offering linear computational complexity and constant memory usage as context length increases. However, despite their efficiency in handling long contexts, recent studies have shown that SSMs, such as Mamba models, generally underperform compared to Transformers in long-context understanding tasks. To address this significant shortfall and achieve both efficient and accurate long-context understanding, we propose LongMamba, a training-free technique that significantly enhances the long-context capabilities of Mamba models. LongMamba builds on our discovery that the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global channels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily responsible for long-context capability. These global channels can become the key bottleneck as the input context lengthens. Specifically, when input lengths largely exceed the training sequence length, global channels exhibit limitations in adaptively extend their receptive fields, leading to Mamba's poor long-context performance. The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the hidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the accumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first identifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token filtering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba sets a new standard for Mamba's long-context performance, significantly extending its operational range without requiring additional training.

However, existing methods have significant limitations: serialized chain-of-thought approaches generate overly long outputs, leading to increased latency and exhausted context windows, while parallel methods such as self-consistency suffer from insufficient coordination, resulting in redundant computations and limited performance gains. To address these shortcomings, we propose Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a novel reasoning framework that enables language models to orchestrate both serialized and parallel computations end-to-end. APR generalizes existing reasoning methods by enabling adaptive multi-threaded inference using spawn() and join() operations. A key innovation is our end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, optimizing both parent and child inference threads to enhance task success rate without requiring predefined reasoning structures. Experiments on the Countdown reasoning task demonstrate significant benefits of APR: (1) higher performance within the same context window (83.4% vs. 60.0% at 4k context); (2) superior scalability with increased computation (80.1% vs. 66.6% at 20k total tokens); (3) improved accuracy at equivalent latency (75.2% vs. 57.3% at approximately 5,000ms).

In this work, we introduce the Riemannian Neural Geodesic Interpolant (RNGI) model, which interpolates between two probability densities on a Riemannian manifold along the stochastic geodesics, and then samples from one endpoint as the final state using the continuous flow originating from the other endpoint. We prove that the temporal marginal density of RNGI solves a transport equation on the Riemannian manifold. After training the model's the neural velocity and score fields, we propose the Embedding Stochastic Differential Equation (E-SDE) algorithm for stochastic sampling of RNGI. E-SDE significantly improves the sampling quality by reducing the accumulated error caused by the excessive intrinsic discretization of Riemannian Brownian motion in the classical Geodesic Random Walk (GRW) algorithm. We also provide theoretical bounds on the generative bias measured in terms of KL-divergence. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RNGI and E-SDE through experiments conducted on both collected and synthetic distributions on S2 and SO(3).",

To tackle these problems, we regard the matrix-vector operations in the standard attention mechanism on vectors in Euclidean space as bilinear forms and linear operators in vector spaces and generalize the attention mechanism to function spaces. This new attention mechanism is fully equivalent to the standard attention but impossible to compute due to the infinite dimensionality of function spaces. To address this, inspired by model reduction techniques, we propose a Subspace Parameterized Attention (SUPRA) neural operator, which approximates the attention mechanism within a finite-dimensional subspace. To construct a subspace on irregular domains for SUPRA, we propose using the Laplacian eigenfunctions, which naturally adapt to domains' geometry and guarantee the optimal approximation for smooth functions. Experiments show that the SUPRA neural operator reduces error rates by up to 33% on various PDE datasets while maintaining state-of-the-art computational efficiency.",

The outputs are then combined in a third neural network to produce final predictions. Our main theoretical result exploits an assumption that the observation patterns can be partitioned into cells on which the Bayes regression function behaves similarly, and belongs to a compositional H\\\"older class. It provides a finite-sample excess risk bound that holds for an arbitrary missingness mechanism, and in combination with a complementary minimax lower bound, demonstrates that our PENN estimator attains in typical cases the minimax rate of convergence as if the cells of the partition were known in advance, up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the sample size.

Previous work in this area has primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search (NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies: the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative contribution exceeding $\\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer. Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.",

Understanding the dynamics of the reverse diffusion process is crucial in steering the generation and achieving high sample quality. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), aim at uncovering the operating principles of models through granular analysis of their internal representations. These MI techniques have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we show that the discovered concepts have a causal effect on the model output and can be leveraged to steer the generative process. We design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages of diffusion image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages of diffusion only minor textural details are subject to change.",

        "abstract": "In deep learning-based classification tasks, the softmax function's temperature parameter $T$ critically influences the output distribution and overall performance. This study presents a novel theoretical insight that the optimal temperature $T^*$ is uniquely determined by the dimensionality of the feature representations, thereby enabling training-free determination of $T^*$. Despite this theoretical grounding, empirical evidence reveals that $T^*$ fluctuates under practical conditions owing to variations in models, datasets, and other confounding factors. To address these influences, we propose and optimize a set of temperature determination coefficients that specify how $T^*$ should be adjusted based on the theoretical relationship to feature dimensionality. Additionally, we insert a batch normalization layer immediately before the output layer, effectively stabilizing the feature space. Building on these coefficients and a suite of large-scale experiments, we develop an empirical formula to estimate $T^*$ without additional training while also introducing a corrective scheme to refine $T^*$ based on the number of classes and task complexity. Our findings confirm that the derived temperature not only aligns with the proposed theoretical perspective but also generalizes effectively across diverse tasks, consistently enhancing classification performance and offering a practical, training-free solution for determining $T^*$.",

        "abstract": "We analyze a learning-to-optimize (L2O) algorithm that exploits parameter space symmetry to enhance optimization efficiency. Prior work has shown that jointly learning symmetry transformations and local updates improves meta-optimizer performance. Supporting this, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that even without identifying the optimal group element, the method locally resembles Newton's method. We further provide an example where the algorithm provably learns the correct symmetry transformation during training. To empirically evaluate L2O with teleportation, we introduce a benchmark, analyze its success and failure cases, and show that enhancements like momentum further improve performance. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging neural network parameter space symmetry to advance meta-optimization.",
