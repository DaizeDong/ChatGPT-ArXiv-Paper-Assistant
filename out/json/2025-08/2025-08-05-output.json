In this work, we propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore, we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal performance degradation.",

        "abstract": "In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation AI systems.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.   To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

We benchmark on DistilBERT and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an 840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a 5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a 3-8\\% speed overhead.

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However, existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{LO}w-rank and \\textbf{S}parse pre-\\textbf{T}raining (\\textbf{LOST}) for LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices, preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead.

By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia, animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the phenomenological withdrawal of such projections.

Although existing sparse attention mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational complexity of important information while retaining complete information, achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings. Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods. Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the challenging needle-in-a-haystack task.

The dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8 points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance without the contrative pre-training.

Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas.

        "abstract": "Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error, which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally, FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate. Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG) demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while maintaining high accuracy.",

The resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies. To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph, which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations alone.",

To address these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models. Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured $\\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and high-performing ST-based models.",

We present a solution with Frequentist-Bayes (FreB), a mathematically rigorous protocol that reshapes AI-generated probability distributions into confidence regions that consistently include true parameters with the expected probability, while achieving minimum size when training and target data align. We demonstrate FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences: identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in observational studies.

However, autonomously building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules: Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus. We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction, using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling challenge.

In contrast, quantum models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability, providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial intelligence of the future.",

To address this fundamental representational flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP, ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient, backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\\ell$. This variant not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\\times$ training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training regime.",

We analyze several architectures and identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.

However, the introduction of privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models. Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.",

However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1) disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits -- where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.",

        "abstract": "Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However, current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions, providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models (4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining multiple LLM outputs.",

However, the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations $\\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection $\\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe consistent improvements with higher values of $\\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\\times$-9$\\times$ reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100 billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of replaying old examples.",

        "abstract": "Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation. However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e., the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states), emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct stages of training.   To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the \"Intervention Detector\" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our findings on steerability dynamics.",

We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover, the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.",

        "abstract": "Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension, prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world, on-device deployments.   We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models. FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.",

We develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space. Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM, and might inspire more data-centric methods.",

The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based adaptive learning.
