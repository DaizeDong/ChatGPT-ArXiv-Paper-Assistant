        "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) to extremely low bit-widths remains challenging due to the fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. While existing ultra-low-bit PTQ methods rely on binary approximations or complex compensation mechanisms, they suffer from either limited representational capacity or computational overhead that undermines their efficiency gains. We introduce PTQ to Trit-Planes (PTQTP), the first ternary-weight PTQ framework that decomposes weight matrices into structured ternary {-1, 0, 1} trit-planes using 2x1.58-bit representation. PTQTP achieves multiplication-free inference, identical to 1-bit quantization, while maintaining superior expressiveness through its novel structured decomposition. Our approach provides: (1) a theoretically grounded progressive approximation algorithm ensuring global weight consistency; (2) model-agnostic deployment across diverse modern LLMs without architectural modifications; and (3) uniform ternary operations that eliminate the need for mixed-precision or compensation schemes. Comprehensive experiments across LLaMA3.x and Qwen3 model families (0.6B-70B parameters) demonstrate that PTQTP significantly outperforms existing low-bit PTQ methods, achieving 82.4% mathematical reasoning retention versus 0% for competing approaches. PTQTP approaches and sometimes surpasses 1.58-bit quantization-aware training performance while requiring only single-hour quantization compared to 10-14 GPU days for training-based methods. These results establish PTQTP as a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

        "abstract": "Attention mechanisms in Transformers have gained significant empirical success. Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass are still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is increasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the interpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified optimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling the optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and efficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional structures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the contractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism can not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms as its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance and even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks. Code is available at this https URL.",

The goal is to find representations (e.g., embeddings in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ or a tree metric) where anchors are placed closer to positive than to negative examples. While finding $\\textit{global}$ optima of contrastive objectives is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard, the complexity of finding $\\textit{local}$ optima -- representations that do not improve by local search algorithms such as gradient-based methods -- remains open. Our work settles the complexity of finding local optima in various contrastive learning problems by proving $\\mathsf{PLS}$-hardness in discrete settings (e.g., maximize satisfied triplets) and $\\mathsf{CLS}$-hardness in continuous settings (e.g., minimize Triplet Loss), where $\\mathsf{PLS}$ (Polynomial Local Search) and $\\mathsf{CLS}$ (Continuous Local Search) are well-studied complexity classes capturing local search dynamics in discrete and continuous optimization, respectively.

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech generation in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.

We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for a more accurate final prediction.To overcome the computational cost, we introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of model parameters.",

However, the fundamental differences between Mamba and Transformer architectures remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use carefully designed synthetic tasks to reveal Mamba's inherent limitations. Through experiments, we identify that Mamba's nonlinear convolution introduces an asymmetry bias that significantly impairs its ability to recognize symmetrical patterns and relationships. Using composite function and inverse sequence matching tasks, we demonstrate that Mamba strongly favors compositional solutions over symmetrical ones and struggles with tasks requiring the matching of reversed sequences. We show these limitations stem not from the SSM module itself but from the nonlinear convolution preceding it, which fuses token information asymmetrically. These insights provide a new understanding of Mamba's constraints and suggest concrete architectural improvements for future sequence models.",

Existing approaches either incur prohibitive computation, suffer cross-domain interference, or require separate runs per domain. We propose DES-MoE, a dynamic expert specialization framework for multi-domain adaptation of Mixture-of-Experts models. DES-MoE addresses catastrophic forgetting through three innovations: (1) an adaptive router balancing pre-trained knowledge retention and task-specific updates via distillation, (2) real-time expert-domain correlation mapping to isolate domain-specific gradients, and (3) a three-phase adaptive fine-tuning schedule that progressively freezes non-specialized parameters. Evaluated on six domains (math, code, law, etc.), DES-MoE matches single-domain ESFT performance while training one unified model, reduces forgetting by 89% compared to full fine-tuning as domains scale from 2 to 6, and achieves 68% faster convergence than conventional methods.

        "abstract": "Post-training fundamentally alters the behavior of large language models (LLMs), yet its impact on the internal parameter space remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of principal linear layers in pretrained LLMs, focusing on two widely adopted post-training methods: instruction tuning and long-chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) distillation. Our analysis reveals two consistent and unexpected structural changes:(1) a near-uniform geometric scaling of singular values across layers, which theoretically modulates attention scores; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix. Disrupting this orthogonal consistency leads to catastrophic performance degradation. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective framework that interprets post-training as a reparameterization of fixed subspaces in the pretrained parameter space. Further experiments reveal that singular value scaling behaves as a secondary effect, analogous to a temperature adjustment, whereas the core functional transformation lies in the coordinated rotation of singular vectors. These results challenge the prevailing view of the parameter space in large models as a black box, uncovering the first clear regularities in how parameters evolve during training, and providing a new perspective for deeper investigation into model parameter changes.",

Existing positional encoding methods demand predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation, we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features.

        "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) based autoencoders often underutilize the global Class token and employ static attention mechanisms, limiting both generative control and optimization efficiency. This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework that addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative linchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global latent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level latent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics directly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of interacting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's influence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables a principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded diagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster functional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to significantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By unifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and controllable approach to transformer-based generation.",

While GPUs remain dominant, they are poorly suited for integration with emerging domain-specific accelerators like the Photonic Tensor Units (PTUs), which offer low-power, high-throughput linear computation. This motivates hybrid compilation strategies that combine photonic and electronic resources. We present LightCode, a compiler framework and simulator for mapping LLM inference workloads across hybrid photonic-electronic systems. LightCode introduces the Stacked Graph, an intermediate representation that encodes multiple hardware-specific realizations of each tensor operation. Hardware assignment is formulated as a constrained subgraph selection problem optimized for latency or energy under parametric cost models. We evaluate LightCode on the prefill stage of GPT-2 and Llama-7B showing that under our workload and hardware assumptions, (i) Photonic hardware reduced energy by up to 50% in our simulated workloads at maximum sequence length; (ii) multiplexing and assignment strategy yielded latency improvements exceeding 10x; and (iii) Optimizing for latency or energy resulted in distinct hardware mappings in our simulations.

        "abstract": "Large neural networks are typically trained for a fixed computational budget, creating a rigid trade-off between performance and efficiency that is ill-suited for deployment in resource-constrained or dynamic environments. Existing approaches to this problem present a difficult choice: training a discrete collection of specialist models is computationally prohibitive, while dynamic methods like slimmable networks often lack the flexibility to be applied to large, pre-trained foundation models. In this work, we propose Nested Subspace Networks (NSNs), a novel architectural paradigm that enables a single model to be dynamically and granularly adjusted across a continuous spectrum of compute budgets at inference time. The core of our approach is to re-parameterize linear layers to satisfy a nested subspace property, such that the function computed at a given rank is a strict subspace of the function at any higher rank. We show that this entire hierarchy of models can be optimized jointly via an uncertainty-aware objective that learns to balance the contributions of different ranks based on their intrinsic difficulty. We demonstrate empirically that NSNs can be surgically applied to pre-trained LLMs and unlock a smooth and predictable compute-performance frontier. For example, a single NSN-adapted model can achieve a 50% reduction in inference FLOPs with only a 5 percentage point loss in accuracy. Our findings establish NSNs as a powerful framework for creating the next generation of adaptive foundation models.",

In parallel, flatness of the loss landscape has been theoretically and empirically linked to generalization. Yet, the causal role of either phenomenon remains unclear: Are they prerequisites for generalization, or merely by-products of training dynamics? We disentangle these questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization precedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from training dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative flatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently predicts it. Models encouraged to collapse or prevented from collapsing generalize equally well, whereas models regularized away from flat solutions exhibit delayed generalization. Furthermore, we show theoretically that neural collapse implies relative flatness under classical assumptions, explaining their empirical co-occurrence. Our results support the view that relative flatness is a potentially necessary and more fundamental property for generalization, and demonstrate how grokking can serve as a powerful probe for isolating its geometric underpinnings.",

We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains.

        "abstract": "Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\\mathbf{7.9\\times}$.",

        "abstract": "While modern Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved major success in multi-task generalization, they often struggle to capture long-range dependencies within their context window. This work introduces a novel approach using meta-tokens, special tokens injected during pre-training, along with a dedicated meta-attention mechanism to guide LMs to use these tokens. We pre-train a language model with a modified GPT-2 architecture equipped with meta-attention in addition to causal multi-head attention, and study the impact of these tokens on a suite of synthetic tasks. We find that data-efficient language model pre-training on fewer than 100B tokens utilizing meta-tokens and our meta-attention mechanism achieves strong performance on these tasks after fine-tuning. We suggest that these gains arise due to the meta-tokens sharpening the positional encoding. This enables them to operate as trainable, content-based landmarks, implicitly compressing preceding context and \"caching\" it in the meta-token. At inference-time, the meta-token points to relevant context, facilitating length generalization up to 2$\\times$ its context window, even after extension with YaRN. We provide further evidence of these behaviors by visualizing model internals to study the residual stream, and assessing the compression quality by information-theoretic analysis on the rate-distortion tradeoff. Our findings suggest that pre-training LMs with meta-tokens offers a simple, data-efficient method to enhance long-context language modeling performance, while introducing new insights into the nature of their behavior towards length generalization.",

Our analysis shows that FiD-GP improves uncertainty estimation ability on various tasks compared with SVGP-based baselines, satisfies tight spectral residual bounds with theoretically guaranteed OoD detection, and significantly compresses the neural network's storage requirements at the cost of increased inference computation dependent on the number of inducing weights employed. Specifically, in a comprehensive empirical study spanning regression, image classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, it cuts Bayesian training cost by several orders of magnitude, compresses parameters by roughly 51%, reduces model size by about 75%, and matches state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimation.",

This paper aims to provide a unified view of the design space of \\texttt{FP4} training. We introduce a comprehensive, quantisation gradient-based framework for microscaling quantization that allows for a theoretical analysis of the computational costs associated with different stabilization methods on both the forward and backward passes. Using a simulator built on this framework, we conduct an extensive empirical study across a wide range of machine learning tasks, including regression, image classification, diffusion models, and language models. By systematically evaluating thousands of combinations of techniques, such as novel gradient approximations, rounding strategies, and scaling methods, we identify which configurations offer the most favourable performance-to-overhead trade-off. We find that the techniques enabling the best trade-off involve carefully combining Hadamard transformations, tensor scaling and stochastic rounding.

Towards a deeper understanding of this framework, we propose and empirically validate The Transfer Neurons Hypothesis: certain neurons in the MLP module are responsible for transferring representations between language-specific latent spaces and a shared semantic latent space.

We demonstrate the discriminative power of activation norms and introduce SEQR, an unsupervised LoRA routing algorithm designed to maximize efficiency while providing strict routing guarantees. SEQR provably identifies the norm-maximizing adapter with significantly greater efficiency, making it a highly scalable and effective solution for dynamic LoRA composition. We validate our results through experiments that demonstrate improved multi-task performance and efficiency.",

Moving beyond minimax theory, this work provides instance-wise comparisons of the finite-sample risks for these algorithms on any well-specified linear regression problem.   Our analysis yields three key findings. First, GD dominates ridge regression: with comparable regularization, the excess risk of GD is always within a constant factor of ridge, but ridge can be polynomially worse even when tuned optimally. Second, GD is incomparable with SGD. While it is known that for certain problems GD can be polynomially better than SGD, the reverse is also true: we construct problems, inspired by benign overfitting theory, where optimally stopped GD is polynomially worse. Finally, GD dominates SGD for a significant subclass of problems -- those with fast and continuously decaying covariance spectra -- which includes all problems satisfying the standard capacity condition.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval systems rely on representations learned by increasingly powerful models. However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned representations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication between representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained neural networks. In the literature, two primary approaches are commonly used to adapt different learned representations: affine transformations, which adapt well to specific distributions but can significantly alter the original representation, and orthogonal transformations, which preserve the original structure with strict geometric constraints but limit adaptability. A key challenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those of previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly learned representation spaces. In this paper, we impose a relaxed orthogonality constraint, namely $\\lambda$-orthogonality regularization, while learning an affine transformation, to obtain distribution-specific adaptation while retaining the original learned representations. Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that it preserves the model's zero-shot performance and ensures compatibility across model updates.

However, RF neurons exhibit limited effective memory capacity and a trade-off between energy efficiency and training speed on complex temporal tasks. Inspired by the dendritic structure of biological neurons, we propose a Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which explicitly incorporates a multi-dendritic and soma architecture. Each dendritic branch encodes specific frequency bands by utilizing the intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of RF neurons, thereby collectively achieving comprehensive frequency representation. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism into the soma structure that adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity, reducing redundant spikes while maintaining training efficiency in long sequence tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while substantially ensuring sparse spikes without compromising computational efficiency during training.

These observations motivate us to leverage causality, a canonical analysis method, to investigate how FC works within LLMs. In particular, we conduct layer-level and token-level causal interventions to dissect FC's impact on the model's internal computational logic when responding to user queries. Our analysis confirms the substantial influence of FC and reveals several in-depth insights into its mechanisms. To further validate our findings, we conduct extensive experiments comparing the effectiveness of FC-based instructions against conventional prompting methods. We focus on enhancing LLM safety robustness, a critical LLM application scenario, and evaluate four mainstream LLMs across two benchmark datasets.

        "abstract": "Many real world categories are multimodal, with single classes occupying disjoint regions in feature space. Classical linear models (logistic regression, linear SVM) use a single global hyperplane and perform poorly on such data, while high-capacity methods (kernel SVMs, deep nets) fit multimodal structure but at the expense of interpretability, heavier tuning, and higher computational cost. We propose the Geometric Mixture Classifier (GMC), a discriminative model that represents each class as a mixture of hyperplanes. Within each class, GMC combines plane scores via a temperature-controlled soft-OR (log-sum-exp), smoothly approximating the max; across classes, standard softmax yields probabilistic posteriors. GMC optionally uses Random Fourier Features (RFF) for nonlinear mappings while keeping inference linear in the number of planes and features. Our practical training recipe: geometry-aware k-means initialization, silhouette-based plane budgeting, alpha annealing, usage-aware L2 regularization, label smoothing, and early stopping, makes GMC plug-and-play. Across synthetic multimodal datasets (moons, circles, blobs, spirals) and tabular/image benchmarks (iris, wine, WDBC, digits), GMC consistently outperforms linear baselines and k-NN, is competitive with RBF-SVM, Random Forests, and small MLPs, and provides geometric introspection via per-plane and class responsibility visualizations. Inference scales linearly in planes and features, making GMC CPU-friendly, with single-digit microsecond latency per example, often faster than RBF-SVM and compact MLPs. Post-hoc temperature scaling reduces ECE from about 0.06 to 0.02. GMC thus strikes a favorable balance of accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency: it is more expressive than linear models and lighter, more transparent, and faster than kernel or deep models.",

Our method adjusts reasoning speed in real time through two complementary signals: (1) token-level model uncertainty for fine-grained step-wise control, and (2) input complexity estimation for informed initialization. We implement this approach with three strategies: Uncertainty-Aware Alpha Scheduling (UA-$\\alpha$S), Complexity-Guided Alpha Initialization (CG-$\\alpha$I), and a Hybrid Adaptive Control (HAC) that combines both.

We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up to two orders of magnitude.

To solve this, we draw inspiration from distribution learning and propose the probabilistic token alignment method as a general and soft mapping for alignment, named as PTA-LLM. Our approach innovatively reformulates token alignment into a classic mathematical problem: optimal transport, seamlessly leveraging distribution-aware learning to facilitate more coherent model fusion. Apart from its inherent generality, PTA-LLM exhibits interpretability from a distributional perspective, offering insights into the essence of the token alignment.

To address this gap, we evaluate closed-book question answering (CBQA) performance across five LLMs from the LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 families. Surprisingly, models fine-tuned on 1,920 samples perform up to 14% worse than those fine-tuned on only 240 samples. Furthermore, varying the level of knowledge mastery in the fine-tuning data leads to performance fluctuations of over 12%. To investigate these effects, we analyze model behavior at both the token and parameter levels. Our analysis reveals that up to 90% of parameter updates during SFT do not contribute to knowledge enhancement. Restoring these updates can improve performance on the CBQA task, depending on the characteristics of the fine-tuning data. These insights offer practical guidance for developing fine-tuning strategies that more effectively strengthen model knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Dual encoder (DE) models, where a pair of matching query and document are embedded into similar vector representations, are widely used in information retrieval due to their simplicity and scalability. However, the Euclidean geometry of the embedding space limits the expressive power of DEs, which may compromise their quality. This paper investigates such limitations in the context of hierarchical retrieval (HR), where the document set has a hierarchical structure and the matching documents for a query are all of its ancestors. We first prove that DEs are feasible for HR as long as the embedding dimension is linear in the depth of the hierarchy and logarithmic in the number of documents. Then we study the problem of learning such embeddings in a standard retrieval setup where DEs are trained on samples of matching query and document pairs. Our experiments reveal a lost-in-the-long-distance phenomenon, where retrieval accuracy degrades for documents further away in the hierarchy. To address this, we introduce a pretrain-finetune recipe that significantly improves long-distance retrieval without sacrificing performance on closer documents. We experiment on a realistic hierarchy from WordNet for retrieving documents at various levels of abstraction, and show that pretrain-finetune boosts the recall on long-distance pairs from 19% to 76%. Finally, we demonstrate that our method improves retrieval of relevant products on a shopping queries dataset.",

        "abstract": "The widespread use of diffusion models has led to an abundance of AI-generated data, raising concerns about model collapse -- a phenomenon in which recursive iterations of training on synthetic data lead to performance degradation. Prior work primarily characterizes this collapse via variance shrinkage or distribution shift, but these perspectives miss practical manifestations of model collapse. This paper identifies a transition from generalization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where models increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content during iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly driven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each training cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation. Motivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy to mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate model collapse. Empirical results show that our approach significantly enhances visual quality and diversity in recursive generation, effectively preventing collapse.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents GraphMend, a high-level compiler that eliminates FX graph breaks in PyTorch 2 programs. Although PyTorch 2 introduced TorchDynamo and TorchInductor to enable just-in-time graph compilation, unresolved dynamic control flow and unsupported Python constructs often fragment models into multiple FX graphs. These fragments force frequent fallbacks to eager mode, incur costly CPU-to-GPU synchronizations, and reduce optimization opportunities. GraphMend addresses this limitation by analyzing and transforming source code before execution. Built on the Jac compilation framework, GraphMend introduces two code transformations that remove graph breaks due to dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions. This design allows PyTorch's compilation pipeline to capture larger, uninterrupted FX graphs without requiring manual refactoring by developers. Evaluation across eight Hugging Face models shows that GraphMend removes all fixable graph breaks due to dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions, driving the break count to 0 in 6 models and reducing it from 5 to 2 in another model. On NVIDIA RTX 3090 and A40 GPUs, GraphMend achieves up to 75% latency reductions and up to 8% higher end-to-end throughput. These results demonstrate that high-level code transformation is an effective complement to PyTorch's dynamic JIT compilation pipeline, substantially improving both usability and performance.",

        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) answer visual questions by transferring information from images to text through a series of attention heads. While this image-to-text information flow is central to visual question answering, its underlying mechanism remains difficult to interpret due to the simultaneous operation of numerous attention heads. To address this challenge, we propose head attribution, a technique inspired by component attribution methods, to identify consistent patterns among attention heads that play a key role in information transfer. Using head attribution, we investigate how LVLMs rely on specific attention heads to identify and answer questions about the main object in an image. Our analysis reveals that a distinct subset of attention heads facilitates the image-to-text information flow. Remarkably, we find that the selection of these heads is governed by the semantic content of the input image rather than its visual appearance. We further examine the flow of information at the token level and discover that (1) text information first propagates to role-related tokens and the final token before receiving image information, and (2) image information is embedded in both object-related and background tokens. Our work provides evidence that image-to-text information flow follows a structured process, and that analysis at the attention-head level offers a promising direction toward understanding the mechanisms of LVLMs.",

        "abstract": "Clinical notes contain rich patient information, such as diagnoses or medications, making them valuable for patient representation learning. Recent advances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract meaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are often missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of patients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations can be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or radiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by clinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality missing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation learning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in multimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion component that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning on missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven assignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning to ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask outcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from specific modality observation patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across MIMIC-IV and eICU show consistent gains over the strongest baselines, achieving up to 13.8% AUC improvement for hospital readmission and 13.1% for ICU admission.",

        "abstract": "The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW) reduces optimal transport on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to a sum of one-dimensional projections, and thanks to this efficiency, it is widely used in geometry, generative modeling, and registration tasks. Recent work shows that quasi-Monte Carlo constructions for computing SW (QSW) yield direction sets with excellent approximation error. This paper presents an alternate, novel approach: learning directions with Bayesian optimization (BO), particularly in settings where SW appears inside an optimization loop (e.g., gradient flows). We introduce a family of drop-in selectors for projection directions: BOSW, a one-shot BO scheme on the unit sphere; RBOSW, a periodic-refresh variant; ABOSW, an adaptive hybrid that seeds from competitive QSW sets and performs a few lightweight BO refinements; and ARBOSW, a restarted hybrid that periodically relearns directions during optimization. Our BO approaches can be composed with QSW and its variants (demonstrated by ABOSW/ARBOSW) and require no changes to downstream losses or gradients. We provide numerical experiments where our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, and on the experimental suite of the original QSW paper, we find that ABOSW and ARBOSW can achieve convergence comparable to the best QSW variants with modest runtime overhead.",

        "abstract": "The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.",

We force the primal and dual networks to mirror the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and dual networks.
