        "abstract": "Disaggregated Large Language Model (LLM) inference has gained popularity as it separates the computation-intensive prefill stage from the memory-intensive decode stage, avoiding the prefill-decode interference and improving resource utilization. However, transmitting Key-Value (KV) data between the two stages can be a bottleneck, especially for long prompts. Additionally, the computation time overhead for prefill and decode is key for optimizing Job Completion Time (JCT), and KV data size can become prohibitive for long prompts and sequences. Existing KV quantization methods can alleviate the transmission bottleneck and reduce memory requirements, but they introduce significant dequantization overhead, exacerbating the computation time.   We propose Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the KV cache (HACK) for disaggregated LLM inference. HACK eliminates the heavy KV dequantization step, and directly performs computations on quantized KV data to approximate and reduce the cost of the expensive matrix-multiplication step. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that HACK reduces JCT by up to 70.9% compared to disaggregated LLM inference baseline and by up to 52.3% compared to state-of-the-art KV quantization methods.",

However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of contrastive learning remain incomplete, with many essential guarantees left unaddressed, particularly the realizability assumption concerning neural approximability of an optimal spectral contrastive loss solution. In this work, we overcome these limitations by analyzing the pointwise and spectral consistency of the augmentation graph Laplacian. We establish that, under specific conditions for data generation and graph connectivity, as the augmented dataset size increases, the augmentation graph Laplacian converges to a weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator on the natural data manifold. These consistency results ensure that the graph Laplacian spectrum effectively captures the manifold geometry. Consequently, they give way to a robust framework for establishing neural approximability, directly resolving the realizability assumption in a current paradigm.",

        "abstract": "With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \\textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.",

This paper proposes a probe-free intervention method FLORAIN for all attention heads in a specific activation layer. It eliminates the need to train classifiers for probing purposes. The intervention function is parametrized by a sample-wise nonlinear low-rank mapping, which is trained by minimizing the distance between the modified activations and their projection onto the manifold of desirable content. Under specific constructions of the manifold and projection distance, we show that the intervention strategy can be computed efficiently by solving a smooth optimization problem.

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks using First-Order (FO) optimizers presents significant computational challenges. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) methods have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing most model parameters and training only a small subset. While PEFT is efficient, it may not outperform full fine-tuning when high task-specific performance is required. Zeroth-Order (ZO) methods offer an alternative for fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model by approximating gradients using only the forward pass, thus eliminating the computational burden of back-propagation in first-order methods. However, when implementing ZO methods, a hard prompt is crucial, and relying on simple, fixed hard prompts may not be optimal. In this paper, we propose a bilevel optimization framework that complements ZO methods with PEFT to mitigate sensitivity to hard prompts while efficiently and effectively fine-tuning LLMs. Our Bilevel ZOFO (Zeroth-Order-First-Order) method employs a double-loop optimization strategy, where only the gradient of the PEFT model and the forward pass of the base model are required. We provide convergence guarantees for Bilevel ZOFO. Empirically, we demonstrate that Bilevel ZOFO outperforms both PEFT and ZO methods in single-task settings while maintaining similar memory efficiency. Additionally, we show its strong potential for multitask learning. Compared to current first-order meta-training algorithms for multitask learning, our method has significantly lower computational demands while maintaining or improving performance.",

This removal is irreversible, often leading to subpar performance in pruned models. Dynamic sparse training, while attempting to adjust sparse structures during training for continual reassessment and refinement, has several limitations including criterion inconsistency between pruning and growth, unsuitability for structured sparsity, and short-sighted growth strategies. Our paper introduces an efficient, innovative paradigm to enhance a given importance criterion for either unstructured or structured sparsity. Our method separates the model into an active structure for exploitation and an exploration space for potential updates. During exploitation, we optimize the active structure, whereas in exploration, we reevaluate and reintegrate parameters from the exploration space through a pruning and growing step consistently guided by the same given importance criterion. To prepare for exploration, we briefly \"reactivate\" all parameters in the exploration space and train them for a few iterations while keeping the active part frozen, offering a preview of the potential performance gains from reintegrating these parameters. We show on various datasets and configurations that existing importance criterion even simple as magnitude can be enhanced with ours to achieve state-of-the-art performance and training cost reductions. Notably, on ImageNet with ResNet50, ours achieves an +1.3 increase in Top-1 accuracy over prior art at 90% ERK sparsity.

Moreover, we show that such velocity fields are minimizers of a training objective containing a specific minimum-energy regularization. We then derive explicit upper bounds for the $C^k$ norm of the velocity field that are polynomial in the $C^k$ norm of the corresponding transport map $T$; in the case of triangular (Knothe--Rosenblatt) maps, we also show that these bounds are polynomial in the $C^k$ norms of the associated source and target densities. Combining these results with stability arguments for distribution approximation via ODEs, we show that Wasserstein or Kullback--Leibler approximation of the target distribution to any desired accuracy $\\epsilon > 0$ can be achieved by a deep neural network representation of the velocity field whose size is bounded explicitly in terms of $\\epsilon$, the dimension, and the smoothness of the source and target densities.

We also demonstrate that, when fine-tuned, the generative approach using the MLM head matches or even surpasses traditional classification-head methods across diverse NLU tasks.This capability emerges specifically in models trained on contemporary, diverse data mixes, with models trained on lower volume, less-diverse data yielding considerably weaker performance.

        "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful behaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\\Theta(\\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\\Theta(\\sqrt{M_{\\text{test}}}/M_{\\text{train}})$, where $M_{\\text{train}}$ and $M_{\\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend \"long-length\" jailbreak attacks via efficient \"short-length\" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.",

        "abstract": "Disentanglement learning is a core issue for understanding and re-using trained information in Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), and effective inductive bias has been reported as a key factor. However, the actual implementation of such bias is still vague. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Multiple Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation (MIPE-transformation), to inject inductive bias by 1) guaranteeing the invertibility of latent-to-latent vector transformation while preserving a certain portion of equivariance of input-to-latent vector transformation, called Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation (IPE-transformation), 2) extending the form of prior and posterior in VAE frameworks to an unrestricted form through a learnable conversion to an approximated exponential family, called Exponential Family conversion (EF-conversion), and 3) integrating multiple units of IPE-transformation and EF-conversion, and their training. In experiments on 3D Cars, 3D Shapes, and dSprites datasets, MIPE-transformation improves the disentanglement performance of state-of-the-art VAEs.",

However, their computational complexity imposes significant limitations on real-time applications and sustainability of AI systems. In this study, we aim to enhance the computational efficiency through model quantization, which represents the weights and activation values with lower precision. Multi-region quantization (MRQ) is introduced to address the asymmetric distribution of network values in DiT blocks by allocating two scaling parameters to sub-regions. Additionally, time-grouping quantization (TGQ) is proposed to reduce quantization error caused by temporal variation in activations. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to the original full-precision model with only a 0.29 increase in FID at W8A8. Furthermore, it outperforms other baselines at W6A6, thereby confirming its suitability for low-bit quantization. These results highlight the potential of our method to enable efficient real-time generative models.",

        "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. However, VLMs are often limited by their use of pretrained image encoders, like CLIP, leading to image understanding errors that hinder overall performance. On top of that, real-world applications often require the model to be continuously adapted as new and often limited data continuously arrive. To address this, we propose LoRSU (Low-Rank Adaptation with Structured Updates), a robust and computationally efficient method for selectively updating image encoders within VLMs. LoRSU introduces structured and localized parameter updates, effectively correcting performance on previously error-prone data while preserving the model's general robustness. Our approach leverages theoretical insights to identify and update only the most critical parameters, achieving significant resource efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that LoRSU reduces computational overhead by over 25x compared to full VLM updates, without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on VQA tasks in the few-shot continual learning setting, validate LoRSU's scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness, making it a compelling solution for image encoder adaptation in resource-constrained environments.",

It is known that the separation power of GNNs is equivalent to that of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test; hence, GNNs are imperfect at identifying all non-isomorphic graphs, which severely limits their expressive power. This work investigates $k$-hop subgraph GNNs that aggregate information from neighbors with distances up to $k$ and incorporate the subgraph structure. We prove that under appropriate assumptions, the $k$-hop subgraph GNNs can approximate any permutation-invariant/equivariant continuous function over graphs without cycles of length greater than $2k+1$ within any error tolerance. We also provide an extension to $k$-hop GNNs without incorporating the subgraph structure. Our numerical experiments on established benchmarks and novel architectures validate our theory on the relationship between the information aggregation distance and the cycle size.",

        "abstract": "CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) has become a popular choice for various downstream tasks. However, recent studies have questioned its ability to represent compositional concepts effectively. These works suggest that CLIP often acts like a bag-of-words (BoW) model, interpreting images and text as sets of individual concepts without grasping the structural relationships. In particular, CLIP struggles to correctly bind attributes to their corresponding objects when multiple objects are present in an image or text. In this work, we investigate why CLIP exhibits this BoW-like behavior. We find that the correct attribute-object binding information is already present in individual text and image modalities. Instead, the issue lies in the cross-modal alignment, which relies on cosine similarity. To address this, we propose Linear Attribute Binding CLIP or LABCLIP. It applies a linear transformation to text embeddings before computing cosine similarity. This approach significantly improves CLIP's ability to bind attributes to correct objects, thereby enhancing its compositional understanding.",

Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.",

Vector similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between an embedded prompt and its nearest neighbor in the cache. Existing systems rely on a static threshold to classify whether the similarity score is sufficiently high to result in a cache hit. We show that this one-size-fits-all threshold is insufficient across different prompts. We propose VectorQ, a framework to learn embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to the complexity and uncertainty of an embedding. Through evaluations on a combination of four diverse datasets, we show that VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems across all static thresholds, achieving up to 12x increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions up to 92%.",

However, its performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the learning rate. A key limitation of gradient descent is its lack of natural scaling, which often necessitates expensive line searches or heuristic tuning to determine an appropriate step size. In this paper, we address this limitation by incorporating Hessian information to scale the gradient direction. By accounting for the curvature of the function along the gradient, our adaptive, Hessian-aware scaling method ensures a local unit step size guarantee, even in nonconvex settings. Near a local minimum that satisfies the second-order sufficient conditions, our approach achieves linear convergence with a unit step size. We show that our method converges globally under a significantly weaker version of the standard Lipschitz gradient smoothness assumption. Even when Hessian information is inexact, the local unit step size guarantee and global convergence properties remain valid under mild conditions. Finally, we validate our theoretical results empirically on a range of convex and nonconvex machine learning tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach.",

We present an idealised illustration, \"Finding Pegasus\", and a novel formal framework with which we categorise AD methods and their results into \"on manifold\" and \"off manifold\". We define these terms and show how they differ. We then use this insight to develop an approach of combining AD methods which significantly boosts AD recall without sacrificing precision in situations employing high DR. When tested on MNIST data, our approach of combining AD methods improves recall by as much as 16 percent compared with simply combining with the best standalone AD method (Isolation Forest), a result which shows great promise for its application to real-world data.",
