## 1. [MMBERT: Scaled Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal BERT for Robust Chinese Hate Speech Detection under Cloaking Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00760) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00760

**Authors:** Qiyao Xue, Yuchen Dou, Ryan Shi, Xiang Lorraine Li, Wei Gao

**Abstract:** Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing in-context learning approaches.

**Comment:** The paper introduces MMBERT, a novel multimodal framework using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, which aligns with model architecture criteria.

## 2. [Adacc: Adaptive Compression and Activation Checkpointing for LLM Memory Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00806) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00806

**Authors:** Ping Chen, Zhuohong Deng, Ping Li, Shuibing He, Hongzi Zhu, Yi Zheng, Zhefeng Wang, Baoxing Huai, Minyi Guo

**Abstract:** Training large language models often employs recomputation to alleviate memory pressure, which can introduce up to 30% overhead in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework that combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the GPU memory footprint. It comprises three modules: (1) We design layer-specific compression algorithms that account for outliers in LLM tensors, instead of directly quantizing floats from FP16 to INT4, to ensure model accuracy. (2) We propose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best memory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training tensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the policy during training to enhance throughput. Experimental results show that Adacc can accelerate the LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining comparable model accuracy to the Baseline.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel memory management framework combining adaptive compression and activation checkpointing, relevant to model compression.

## 3. [Learning to optimize with guarantees: a complete characterization of linearly convergent algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00775) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00775

**Authors:** Andrea Martin, Ian R. Manchester, Luca Furieri

**Abstract:** In high-stakes engineering applications, optimization algorithms must come with provable worst-case guarantees over a mathematically defined class of problems. Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices performance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We address the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to improve its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems - for example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control (MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its worst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we characterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for classes of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting from a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the modifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our results apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for nonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for strongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over polyhedral feasibility sets. We showcase effectiveness of the approach on solving optimization problems with tight iteration budgets in application to ill-conditioned systems of linear equations and MPC for linear systems.

**Comment:** The paper provides a theoretical characterization of linearly convergent algorithms, which aligns with the emerging trends criterion.

## 4. [Embryology of a Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00331) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00331

**Authors:** George Wang, Garrett Baker, Andrew Gordon, Daniel Murfet

**Abstract:** Understanding how language models develop their internal computational structure is a central problem in the science of deep learning. While susceptibilities, drawn from statistical physics, offer a promising analytical tool, their full potential for visualizing network organization remains untapped. In this work, we introduce an embryological approach, applying UMAP to the susceptibility matrix to visualize the model's structural development over training. Our visualizations reveal the emergence of a clear ``body plan,'' charting the formation of known features like the induction circuit and discovering previously unknown structures, such as a ``spacing fin'' dedicated to counting space tokens. This work demonstrates that susceptibility analysis can move beyond validation to uncover novel mechanisms, providing a powerful, holistic lens for studying the developmental principles of complex neural networks.

**Comment:** The paper provides insights into the internal structure development of language models, which is relevant to representation learning and understanding LLM behavior.

## 5. [Watch the Weights: Unsupervised monitoring and control of fine-tuned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00161) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00161

**Authors:** Ziqian Zhong, Aditi Raghunathan

**Abstract:** The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.   In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations, thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during fine-tuning with high precision.   For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney prompt generation.   Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/fjzzq2002/WeightWatch.

**Comment:** The paper presents a novel method for monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs by interpreting weights, which is relevant to understanding LLM behavior and interpretability.

## 6. [Systematic Evaluation of Optimization Techniques for Long-Context Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00305) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00305

**Authors:** Ammar Ahmed, Sheng Di, Franck Cappello, Zirui Liu, Jingoo Han, Ali Anwar

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations, characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70 billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts. Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.

**Comment:** The paper systematically evaluates optimization techniques like pruning and quantization for LLMs, aligning with the model compression criterion.

## 7. [Thinking Machines: Mathematical Reasoning in the Age of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00459) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00459

**Authors:** Andrea Asperti, Alberto Naibo, Claudio Sacerdoti Coen

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in structured reasoning and symbolic tasks, with coding emerging as a particular area of strength. This success has sparked growing interest in applying LLMs to mathematics, both in informal problem-solving and formal theorem proving. However, progress in formal mathematics has proven to be significantly more difficult, despite surface-level similarities between programming and proof construction. This discrepancy raises important questions about how LLMs ``reason'', how they are supervised, and whether they internally track a notion of computational or deductive state. In this article, we address the state-of-the-art of the discipline, focusing on recent models and benchmarks, and explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and mathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between formal and informal mathematics as training domains; (ii) the deeper reasons why proof generation remains more brittle than code synthesis; (iii) and the question of whether LLMs represent, or merely mimic, a notion of evolving logical state. Our goal is not to draw hard boundaries, but to identify where the current limits lie, and how they might be extended.

**Comment:** The paper explores theoretical insights into LLM behavior, particularly in mathematical reasoning, aligning with foundational research in LLMs.

## 8. [FMPlug: Plug-In Foundation Flow-Matching Priors for Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00721) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00721

**Authors:** Yuxiang Wan, Ryan Devera, Wenjie Zhang, Ju Sun

**Abstract:** We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

**Comment:** The paper introduces FMPlug, a novel framework leveraging foundation flow-matching priors for inverse problems, which aligns with foundational research in AI for Science.

## 9. [Separated-Variable Spectral Neural Networks: A Physics-Informed Learning Approach for High-Frequency PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00628) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00628

**Authors:** Xiong Xiong, Zhuo Zhang, Rongchun Hu, Chen Gao, Zichen Deng

**Abstract:** Solving high-frequency oscillatory partial differential equations (PDEs) is a critical challenge in scientific computing, with applications in fluid mechanics, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetic wave propagation. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from spectral bias, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency solution components.  We introduce Separated-Variable Spectral Neural Networks (SV-SNN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by integrating separation of variables with adaptive spectral methods. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) decomposition of multivariate functions into univariate function products, enabling independent spatial and temporal networks; (2) adaptive Fourier spectral features with learnable frequency parameters for high-frequency capture; and (3) theoretical framework based on singular value decomposition to quantify spectral bias. Comprehensive evaluation on benchmark problems including Heat equation, Helmholtz equation, Poisson equations and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrates that SV-SNN achieves 1-3 orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy while reducing parameter count by over 90\% and training time by 60\%. These results establish SV-SNN as an effective solution to the spectral bias problem in neural PDE solving. The implementation will be made publicly available upon acceptance at https://github.com/xgxgnpu/SV-SNN.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel framework for solving high-frequency PDEs using neural networks, addressing spectral bias with a theoretical framework based on singular value decomposition. This aligns with representation learning and model architecture innovations.

## 10. [Towards Higher Effective Rank in Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning using Khatri--Rao Product](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00230) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00230

**Authors:** Paul Albert, Frederic Z. Zhang, Hemanth Saratchandran, Anton van den Hengel, Ehsan Abbasnejad

**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties. Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks. To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune billion-scale parameter models.

**Comment:** The paper introduces KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm using the Khatri-Rao product for higher effective rank, relevant to model compression and efficiency.

## 11. [Graph Lineages and Skeletal Graph Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00197) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00197

**Authors:** Eric Mjolsness, Cory B. Scott

**Abstract:** Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2) bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product, disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers (useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal" functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and (hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces) and to multigrid numerical methods.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a new algebraic type theory for graded graphs and hierarchical graph lineages, which is relevant to model architecture innovations.

## 12. [Sheaf Graph Neural Networks via PAC-Bayes Spectral Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00357) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00357

**Authors:** Yoonhyuk Choi, Jiho Choi, Chong-Kwon Kim

**Abstract:** Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and demonstrate that the resulting bound-aware objective can be achieved via end-to-end training in linear computational complexity. Experiments on nine homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified confidence intervals on unseen nodes.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel architecture for Graph Neural Networks using PAC-Bayes spectral optimization, which aligns with the model architecture criterion.

## 13. [Reinitializing weights vs units for maintaining plasticity in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00212) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00212

**Authors:** J. Fernando Hernandez-Garcia, Shibhansh Dohare, Jun Luo, Rich S. Sutton

**Abstract:** Loss of plasticity is a phenomenon in which a neural network loses its ability to learn when trained for an extended time on non-stationary data. It is a crucial problem to overcome when designing systems that learn continually. An effective technique for preventing loss of plasticity is reinitializing parts of the network. In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization schemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights. We propose a new algorithm, which we name \textit{selective weight reinitialization}, for reinitializing the least useful weights in a network. We compare our algorithm to continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that reinitialize units in the network. Through our experiments in continual supervised learning problems, we identify two settings when reinitializing weights is more effective at maintaining plasticity than reinitializing units: (1) when the network has a small number of units and (2) when the network includes layer normalization. Conversely, reinitializing weights and units are equally effective at maintaining plasticity when the network is of sufficient size and does not include layer normalization. We found that reinitializing weights maintains plasticity in a wider variety of settings than reinitializing units.

**Comment:** The paper explores reinitialization techniques to maintain plasticity in neural networks, which is relevant to representation learning and training dynamics.

## 14. [Invariant Graph Transformer for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00304) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00304

**Authors:** Tianyin Liao, Ziwei Zhang, Yufei Sun, Chunyu Hu, Jianxin Li

**Abstract:** Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated great effectiveness across various graph analytical tasks. However, the existing GTs focus on training and testing graph data originated from the same distribution, but fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph representations that can to unseen graphs. We also provide theoretical justifications for our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.

**Comment:** The paper introduces GOODFormer, a Graph Transformer for out-of-distribution generalization, focusing on invariant graph learning, which is relevant to model architecture innovations.

## 15. [Stress-Aware Resilient Neural Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00098) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00098

**Authors:** Ashkan Shakarami, Yousef Yeganeh, Azade Farshad, Lorenzo Nicole, Stefano Ghidoni, Nassir Navab

**Abstract:** This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic) Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers, and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a stress-aware learning paradigm with a novel optimizer, relevant to training dynamics in neural networks.

## 16. [Improved Robustness and Functional Localization in Topographic CNNs Through Weight Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00043) <a id="link16"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00043

**Authors:** Nhut Truong, Uri Hasson

**Abstract:** Topographic neural networks are computational models that can simulate the spatial and functional organization of the brain. Topographic constraints in neural networks can be implemented in multiple ways, with potentially different impacts on the representations learned by the network. The impact of such different implementations has not been systematically examined. To this end, here we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two spatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to develop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which enforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on classification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input degradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared to both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved robustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii) greater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii) stronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations positioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in orientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units, indicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational geometry of the network. Our findings suggest that during end-to-end training, WS constraints produce more robust representations than AS or non-topographic CNNs. These findings also suggest that weight-based spatial constraints can shape feature learning and functional organization in biophysical inspired models.

**Comment:** The paper examines topographic constraints in CNNs, providing insights into representation learning and model architecture.

## 17. [Sinusoidal Approximation Theorem for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00247) <a id="link17"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.00247

**Authors:** Sergei Gleyzer, Hanh Nguyen, Dinesh P. Ramakrishnan, Eric A. F. Reinhardt

**Abstract:** The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem states that any continuous multivariable function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of continuous single variable functions. Subsequent simplifications of this representation involve expressing these functions as parameterized sums of a smaller number of unique monotonic functions. These developments led to the proof of the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron networks with sigmoidal activations, forming the alternative theoretical direction of most modern neural networks.   Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as an alternative to multilayer perceptrons. KANs feature learnable nonlinear activations applied directly to input values, modeled as weighted sums of basis spline functions. This approach replaces the linear transformations and sigmoidal post-activations used in traditional perceptrons. Subsequent works have explored alternatives to spline-based activations. In this work, we propose a novel KAN variant by replacing both the inner and outer functions in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of learnable frequencies. Inspired by simplifications introduced by Lorentz and Sprecher, we fix the phases of the sinusoidal activations to linearly spaced constant values and provide a proof of its theoretical validity. We also conduct numerical experiments to evaluate its performance on a range of multivariable functions, comparing it with fixed-frequency Fourier transform methods and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We show that it outperforms the fixed-frequency Fourier transform and achieves comparable performance to MLPs.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks using sinusoidal functions, which aligns with the model architecture criterion.

>   - Focus: Maintains a link to the core topic but also extends into at least one other domain/area beyond the primary focus.
>   - Examples: Work referencing MoE centered on reinforcement learning.
> 
> - Relevance 3-4 (Irrelevant)
>   - Focus: Largely outside our interests with no association to our topics.
>   - Examples: Application-focused papers like using MoE to solve a problem in the real world.
> 
> - Relevance 1-2 (Ignore)
>   - Focus: Purely unrelated to our topics. Completely a different domain.
>   - **Exception**: If the paper hints at a cutting-edge, radically new direction that could eventually transform the primary domain, consider a score of 9–10 despite initial appearances. (Usually a very rare concept that belongs to the fundamental research)
> 
> ### Novelty Scoring
> 
> - Novelty 9-10 (Breakthrough)
>   - Definition: Groundbreaking methods/theory introducing new directions or solving major challenges.
>   - Examples: Entirely new paradigm for foundational models; a novel theory transforming representation learning.
> 
> - Novelty 7-8 (Improvements)
>   - Definition: Substantial insights/enhancements, though not a full paradigm shift.
>   - Examples: Modifications on existing methods yielding significantly better results.
> 
> - Novelty 5-6 (Borderline)
>   - Definition: Incremental contributions with possible long-term benefits, not immediately transformative.
>   - Examples: Moderately novel extension to an existing architecture; refining current methods without fundamentally altering them.
> 
> - Novelty 3-4 (Tangential)
>   - Definition: Minor or domain-specific improvements with limited broader impact.
>   - Examples: Slight modifications to known methods with strange motivation; purely engineering jobs like a new benchmark/dataset.
> 
> - Novelty 1-2 (Low)
>   - Definition: Minimal originality, applying standard approaches without real innovation.
>   - Examples: Using an off-the-shelf model without adding new insights; purely application-driven studies like finetuning a pretrained model using existing methods.
