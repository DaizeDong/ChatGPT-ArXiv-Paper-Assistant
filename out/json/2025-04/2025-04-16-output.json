        "title": "A Dual-Space Framework for General Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models. During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer more information. However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework exhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different output spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the student model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different vocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the distributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different prediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and dimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher and the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors with ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the student/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from different models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the distributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm to align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the above, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both off-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and surpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.",

Our implementation creates an interconnected graph of reasoning nodes. Experiments on diverse reasoning tasks (syllogistic, mathematical, algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric) demonstrate that WoT achieves superior performance compared to traditional methods, particularly for complex problems.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across a variety of tasks, partly due to advanced prompting techniques. However, these techniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs and can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs. While prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods confront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context changes, and remaining effective across different tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts (LLM-DCP). Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to preserve the performance as much as possible. We model prompt compression as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove redundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content. We develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the compression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key information. This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external black-box LLM. Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum learning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training strategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the DCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information integrity. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially at higher compression rates. The code for our approach will be available at https://github.com/Fhujinwu/DCP.",

        "abstract": "Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).",

We argue that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, our method naturally enables the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost.

This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi.

Recent research indicates that models demonstrating linearity enhance the performance of task arithmetic. In contrast to existing methods that rely on the global linearization of the model, we argue that this linearity already exists within the model's submodules. In particular, we present a statistical analysis and show that submodules (e.g., layers, self-attentions, and MLPs) exhibit significantly higher linearity than the overall model. Based on these findings, we propose an innovative model merging strategy that independently merges these submodules. Especially, we derive a closed-form solution for optimal merging weights grounded in the linear properties of these submodules. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the standard task arithmetic approach and other established baselines across different model scales and various tasks. This result highlights the benefits of leveraging the linearity of submodules and provides a new perspective for exploring solutions for effective and practical multi-task model merging.",

We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters.

Current research mainly targets identifying or mitigating a single shortcut; however, in real-world scenarios, cues within the data are diverse and unknown. In empirical studies, we reveal that the models rely to varying extents on different shortcuts. Compared to weak shortcuts, models depend more heavily on strong shortcuts, resulting in their poor generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose MiMu, a novel method integrated with Transformer-based ERMs designed to Mitigate Multiple shortcut learning behavior, which incorporates self-calibration strategy and self-improvement strategy. In the source model, we preliminarily propose the self-calibration strategy to prevent the model from relying on shortcuts and make overconfident predictions. Then, we further design self-improvement strategy in target model to reduce the reliance on multiple shortcuts. The random mask strategy involves randomly masking partial attention positions to diversify the focus of target model other than concentrating on a fixed region. Meanwhile, the adaptive attention alignment module facilitates the alignment of attention weights to the calibrated source model, without the need for post-hoc attention maps or supervision. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) demonstrate the effectiveness of MiMu in improving robustness generalization abilities.",

Prior work has solely focused on constrained multi-task settings where there is a one-to-one mapping between a sample and a task, overlooking the paradigm where multiple tasks may operate on the same sample, e.g., scene understanding. In this paper, we focus on the multi-task setting with single-input-multiple-outputs (SIMO) and show that it qualitatively differs from the single-input-single-output model merging settings studied in the literature due to the existence of task-specific decoders and diverse loss objectives. We identify that existing model merging methods lead to significant performance degradation, primarily due to representation misalignment between the merged encoder and task-specific decoders. We propose two simple and efficient fixes for the SIMO setting to re-align the feature representation after merging. Compared to joint fine-tuning, our approach is computationally effective and flexible, and sheds light into identifying task relationships in an offline manner. Experiments on NYUv2, Cityscapes, and a subset of the Taskonomy dataset demonstrate: (1) task arithmetic suffices to enable multi-task capabilities; however, the representations generated by the merged encoder has to be re-aligned with the task-specific heads; (2) the proposed architecture rivals traditional multi-task learning in performance but requires fewer samples and training steps by leveraging the existence of task-specific models.",

However, computing the exact KL divergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus, practitioners often resort to the use of sampling-based estimators. While it is easy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator notoriously suffers from high variance, and can even result in a negative estimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we introduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is also unbiased and provably has variance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In an empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially in practice. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator of the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and produces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward vs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.",

In this paper, we systematically elucidate the design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify tokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as major bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved generative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning, and data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision, demonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural modeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure generation diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by reducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B baselines and on par with the specialized folding models.",

        "abstract": "There is increasing interest in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by casting them as machine learning problems. Recently, there has been a spike in exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional neural networks represented by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While showing promise, their performance advantages in physics-based problems remain largely unexplored. Several critical questions persist: Can KANs capture complex physical dynamics and under what conditions might they outperform traditional architectures? In this work, we present a comparative study of KANs and MLPs for learning physical systems governed by PDEs. We assess their performance when applied in deep operator networks (DeepONet) and graph network-based simulators (GNS), and test them on physical problems that vary significantly in scale and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the Kolmogorov Representation Theorem, we examine the behavior of KANs and MLPs across shallow and deep network architectures. Our results reveal that although KANs do not consistently outperform MLPs when configured as deep neural networks, they demonstrate superior expressiveness in shallow network settings, significantly outpacing MLPs in accuracy over our test cases. This suggests that KANs are a promising choice, offering a balance of efficiency and accuracy in applications involving physical systems.",
