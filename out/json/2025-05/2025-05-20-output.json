        "abstract": "We propose a principled and effective framework for one-step generative modeling. We introduce the notion of average velocity to characterize flow fields, in contrast to instantaneous velocity modeled by Flow Matching methods. A well-defined identity between average and instantaneous velocities is derived and used to guide neural network training. Our method, termed the MeanFlow model, is self-contained and requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. MeanFlow demonstrates strong empirical performance: it achieves an FID of 3.43 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256x256 trained from scratch, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion/flow models. Our study substantially narrows the gap between one-step diffusion/flow models and their multi-step predecessors, and we hope it will motivate future research to revisit the foundations of these powerful models.",

        "abstract": "Mixture of Experts (MoE) models constitute a widely utilized class of ensemble learning approaches in statistics and machine learning, known for their flexibility and computational efficiency. They have become integral components in numerous state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures, particularly for analyzing heterogeneous data across diverse domains. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of model selection, especially concerning the optimal number of mixture components or experts, remains limited and poses significant challenges. These challenges primarily stem from the inclusion of covariates in both the Gaussian gating functions and expert networks, which introduces intrinsic interactions governed by partial differential equations with respect to their parameters. In this paper, we revisit the concept of dendrograms of mixing measures and introduce a novel extension to Gaussian-gated Gaussian MoE models that enables consistent estimation of the true number of mixture components and achieves the pointwise optimal convergence rate for parameter estimation in overfitted scenarios. Notably, this approach circumvents the need to train and compare a range of models with varying numbers of components, thereby alleviating the computational burden, particularly in high-dimensional or deep neural network settings. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately recovering the number of experts. It outperforms common criteria such as the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the integrated completed likelihood, while achieving optimal convergence rates for parameter estimation and accurately approximating the regression function.",

        "abstract": "Positional encoding (PE) is essential for enabling Transformers to model sequential structure. However, the mechanisms by which different PE schemes couple token content and positional information-and how these mechanisms influence model dynamics-remain theoretically underexplored. In this work, we present a unified framework that analyzes PE through the spectral properties of Toeplitz and related matrices derived from attention logits. We show that multiplicative content-position coupling-exemplified by Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) via a Hadamard product with a Toeplitz matrix-induces spectral contraction, which theoretically improves optimization stability and efficiency. Guided by this theory, we construct synthetic tasks that contrast content-position dependent and content-position independent settings, and evaluate a range of PE methods. Our experiments reveal strong alignment with theory: RoPE consistently outperforms other methods on position-sensitive tasks and induces \"single-head deposit\" patterns in early layers, indicating localized positional processing. Further analyses show that modifying the method and timing of PE coupling, such as MLA in Deepseek-V3, can effectively mitigate this concentration. These results establish explicit content-relative mixing with relative-position Toeplitz signals as a key principle for effective PE design and provide new insight into how positional structure is integrated in Transformer architectures.",

We use such stripped LLMs as vertexes and optimizable seq2seq modules as edges to construct LMNet, with similar structure as MLPs. By utilizing smaller pre-trained LLMs as vertexes, we train a LMNet that achieves comparable performance with LLMs in similar size with only less than 0.1% training cost. This offers a new perspective on scaling for general intelligence rather than training a monolithic LLM from scratch. Besides, the proposed method can be used for other applications, like customizing LLM with limited data, showing its versatility.",

[Methods] A formal information model is first constructed, utilizing sets of well-formed formulas to explicitly define the ontological states and carrier mappings of typical components in machine learning. Learnable and processable predicates, along with learning and processing functions, are introduced to analyze the logical deduction and constraint rules of the causal chains within models. [Results] A meta-framework for machine learning theory (MLT-MF) is established. Based on this framework, universal definitions for model interpretability and ethical safety are proposed. Furthermore, three key theorems are proved: the equivalence of model interpretability and information recoverability, the assurance of ethical safety, and the estimation of generalization error. [Limitations] The current framework assumes ideal conditions with noiseless information-enabling mappings and primarily targets model learning and processing logic in static scenarios. It does not yet address information fusion and conflict resolution across ontological spaces in multimodal or multi-agent systems.

We extend our discoveries there into deterministic bounds of the metric tensor on the neuromanifold.

        "abstract": "Distributional robustness is a central goal of prediction algorithms due to the prevalent distribution shifts in real-world data.

Causality provides a modeling framework with a rigorous robustness guarantee in the above sense, where the uncertainty set is data-driven rather than pre-specified as in traditional distributional robustness optimization. However, current causality-inspired robustness methods possess finite-radius robustness guarantees only in the linear settings, where the causal relationships among the covariates and the response are linear. In this work, we propose a nonlinear method under a causal framework by incorporating recent developments in identifiable representation learning and establish a distributional robustness guarantee. To our best knowledge, this is the first causality-inspired robustness method with such a finite-radius robustness guarantee in nonlinear settings.

We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency.

        "abstract": "With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance. UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions, using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3) Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression. Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base) with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression.",

These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training or on the optimal training time given the model size. In this work, we uncover a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics through the lens of spectral complexity norms. We identify two novel dynamical scaling laws that govern how performance evolves during training. These laws together recover the well-known test error scaling at convergence, offering a mechanistic explanation of generalization emergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a solvable model: a single-layer perceptron trained with binary cross-entropy. In this setting, we show that the growth of spectral complexity driven by the implicit bias mirrors the generalization behavior observed at fixed norm, allowing us to connect the performance dynamics to classical learning rules in the perceptron.",

However, a significant gap remains between their practical use and our current theoretical understanding: prior analyses (1) overlook the layer-wise LMO application of these optimizers in practice, and (2) rely on an unrealistic smoothness assumption, leading to impractically small stepsizes. To address both, we propose a new LMO-based method called $\\sf Gluon$, capturing prior theoretically analyzed methods as special cases, and introduce a new refined generalized smoothness model that captures the layer-wise geometry of neural networks, matches the layer-wise practical implementation of $\\sf Muon$ and $\\sf Scion$, and leads to convergence guarantees with strong practical predictive power. Unlike prior results, our theoretical stepsizes closely match the fine-tuned values reported by Pethick et al. (2025).

        "abstract": "Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning, (2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency.

        "abstract": "Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however, their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\\tt A^\\tt 3$, a post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ splits a Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\\tt QK$, $\\tt OV$, and $\\tt MLP$. For each component, $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ provides an analytical solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while minimizing the component's functional loss ($\\it i.e.$, error in attention scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example, under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2, outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18.

        "abstract": "LLM pruning has emerged as a promising technology for compressing LLMs, enabling their deployment on resource-limited devices. However, current methodologies typically require access to public calibration samples, which can be challenging to obtain in privacy-sensitive domains. To address this issue, we introduce FedPrLLM, a comprehensive federated pruning framework designed for the privacy-preserving compression of LLMs. In FedPrLLM, each client only needs to calculate a pruning mask matrix based on its local calibration data and share it with the server to prune the global model. This approach allows for collaborative pruning of the global model with the knowledge of each client while maintaining local data privacy. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore various possibilities within the FedPrLLM framework, including different comparison groups, pruning strategies, and the decision to scale weights. Our extensive evaluation reveals that one-shot pruning with layer comparison and no weight scaling is the optimal choice within the FedPrLLM framework. We hope our work will help guide future efforts in pruning LLMs in privacy-sensitive fields. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/FedPrLLM.",

        "abstract": "Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical findings.",

We evaluate CHG across multiple large language models (LLMs) in the Llama 3 model family and diverse tasks, including syntax, commonsense, and mathematical reasoning, and show that CHG scores yield causal - not merely correlational - insight, validated via ablation and causal mediation analyses. We also introduce contrastive CHG, a variant that isolates sub-circuits for specific task components.

        "abstract": "Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures could achieve impressive computational efficiency with expert parallelism, which relies heavily on all-to-all communication across devices. Unfortunately, such communication overhead typically constitutes a significant portion of the total runtime, hampering the scalability of distributed training and inference for modern MoE models (consuming over $40\\%$ runtime in large-scale training). In this paper, we first define collaborative communication to illustrate this intrinsic limitation, and then propose system- and algorithm-level innovations to reduce communication costs. Specifically, given a pair of experts co-activated by one token, we call them \"collaborated\", which comprises $2$ cases as intra- and inter-collaboration, depending on whether they are kept on the same device. Our pilot investigations reveal that augmenting the proportion of intra-collaboration can accelerate expert parallelism at scale. It motivates us to strategically optimize collaborative communication for accelerated MoE training and inference, dubbed Occult. Our designs are capable of either delivering exact results with reduced communication cost or controllably minimizing the cost with collaboration pruning, materialized by modified fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on various MoE-LLMs demonstrate that Occult can be faster than popular state-of-the-art inference or training frameworks (more than $1.5\\times$ speed up across multiple tasks and models) with comparable or superior quality compared to the standard fine-tuning.

Existing RMC methods have several limitations: they require a relatively large number of observed entries; they may fail under overparametrization, when their assumed rank is higher than the correct one; and many of them fail to recover even mildly ill-conditioned matrices. In this paper we propose a novel RMC method, denoted $\\texttt{RGNMR}$, which overcomes these limitations. $\\texttt{RGNMR}$ is a simple factorization-based iterative algorithm, which combines a Gauss-Newton linearization with removal of entries suspected to be outliers. On the theoretical front, we prove that under suitable assumptions, $\\texttt{RGNMR}$ is guaranteed exact recovery of the underlying low rank matrix. Our theoretical results improve upon the best currently known for factorization-based methods. On the empirical front, we show via several simulations the advantages of $\\texttt{RGNMR}$ over existing RMC methods, and in particular its ability to handle a small number of observed entries, overparameterization of the rank and ill-conditioned matrices.",

Real-world data, however, often departs from perfect symmetry because of noise, structural variation, measurement bias, or other symmetry-breaking effects. Strictly equivariant models may struggle to fit the data, while unconstrained models lack a principled way to leverage partial symmetries. Even when the data is fully symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance. This gradual tightening smooths training early on and settles the model at a data-driven equilibrium, balancing between equivariance and non-equivariance. Across multiple architectures and tasks, our method consistently improves performance metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared with strictly equivariant models and heuristic equivariance relaxations.",

We demonstrate that the Hamiltonian Neural Functional can be an effective surrogate model through improved stability and conserving energy-like quantities on 1D and 2D PDEs.

Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present ChromFound, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell type annotation and cross-omics prediction.

Memristor technology offers promising hardware for such neuromorphic systems due to its potential for efficient in-memory analog computing. Hopfield Neural Networks (HNNs) are a classic model for associative memory, but implementations on conventional hardware suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, while prior memristor-based HNNs faced challenges with vulnerability to hardware defects due to offline training, limited storage capacity, and difficulty processing analog patterns. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate on integrated memristor hardware a new hardware-adaptive learning algorithm for associative memories that significantly improves defect tolerance and capacity, and naturally extends to scalable multilayer architectures capable of handling both binary and continuous patterns. Our approach achieves 3x effective capacity under 50% device faults compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, its extension to multilayer architectures enables superlinear capacity scaling (\\(\\propto N^{1.49}\\ for binary patterns) and effective recalling of continuous patterns (\\propto N^{1.74}\\ scaling), as compared to linear capacity scaling for previous HNNs. It also provides flexibility to adjust capacity by tuning hidden neurons for the same-sized patterns. By leveraging the massive parallelism of the hardware enabled by synchronous updates, it reduces energy by 8.8x and latency by 99.7% for 64-dimensional patterns over asynchronous schemes, with greater improvements at scale.

In this paper, we critically examine that interpretation by investigating how the semantics of intermediate tokens-often anthropomorphized as \"thoughts\" or reasoning traces and which are claimed to display behaviors like backtracking, self-verification etc.-actually influence model performance. We train transformer models on formally verifiable reasoning traces and solutions, constraining both intermediate steps and final outputs to align with those of a formal solver (in our case, A* search). By constructing a formal interpreter of the semantics of our problems and intended algorithm, we systematically evaluate not only solution accuracy but also the correctness of intermediate traces, thus allowing us to evaluate whether the latter causally influences the former. We notice that, despite significant improvements on the solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces still produce invalid reasoning traces when arriving at correct solutions. To further show that trace accuracy is only loosely connected to solution accuracy, we then train models on noisy, corrupted traces which have no relation to the specific problem each is paired with, and find that not only does performance remain largely consistent with models trained on correct data, but in some cases can improve upon it and generalize more robustly on out-of-distribution tasks. These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or \"Chains of Thought\" induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly correct forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language models.",

In contrast, applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization method.

We develop a formal framework for majority-minority learning tasks, showing how standard training can favor majority groups and produce stereotypical predictors that neglect minority-specific features. Assuming population and variance imbalance, our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) the close proximity between ``full-data'' and stereotypical predictors, (ii) the dominance of a region where training the entire model tends to merely learn the majority traits, and (iii) a lower bound on the additional training required.

        "abstract": "Graphs serve as versatile data structures in numerous real-world domains-including social networks, molecular biology, and knowledge graphs-by capturing intricate relational information among entities. Among graph-based learning techniques, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has gained significant attention for its ability to derive robust, self-supervised graph representations through the contrasting of positive and negative sample pairs. However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL (Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power improves. Extensive experiments on diverse graph-level classification tasks demonstrate that SRGCL, as a plug-in module, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GCL methods, underscoring its adaptability and efficacy across various domains.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a core component in the training and deployment of modern generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs). While its empirical benefits are well documented--enabling smaller student models to emulate the performance of much larger teachers--the underlying mechanisms by which KD improves generative quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a minimal working explanation of KD in generative modeling. Using a controlled simulation with mixtures of Gaussians, we demonstrate that distillation induces a trade-off between precision and recall in the student model. As the teacher distribution becomes more selective, the student concentrates more probability mass on high-likelihood regions at the expense of coverage--a behavior modulated by a single entropy-controlling parameter. We then validate this effect in a large-scale language modeling setup using the SmolLM2 family of models. Empirical results reveal the same precision-recall dynamics observed in simulation, where precision corresponds to sample quality and recall to distributional coverage. This precision-recall trade-off proves especially beneficial in scenarios where sample quality outweighs diversity, such as instruction tuning or downstream generation. Our analysis provides a simple and general explanation for the effectiveness of KD in generative modeling.",

The method is motivated theoretically, and its utility is demonstrated on practical examples: MNIST, CIFAR, IMDb. A systematic numerical study reveals that parallel implementations of SMC and MCMC are comparable to serial implementations in terms of performance and total cost, and they achieve accuracy at or beyond the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like deep ensembles at convergence, along with substantially improved uncertainty quantification (UQ)--in particular, epistemic UQ. But even parallel implementations are expensive, with an irreducible time barrier much larger than the cost of the MAP estimator. Compressing time further leads to rapid degradation of accuracy, whereas UQ remains valuable. By anchoring to a point estimator we can recover accuracy, while retaining valuable UQ, ultimately delivering strong performance across metrics for a cost comparable to the SOTA.",

        "abstract": "The recent explosion of large language models (LLMs), each with its own general or specialized strengths, makes scalable, reliable benchmarking more urgent than ever. Standard practices nowadays face fundamental trade-offs: closed-ended question-based benchmarks (eg MMLU) struggle with saturation as newer models emerge, while crowd-sourced leaderboards (eg Chatbot Arena) rely on costly and slow human judges. Recently, automated methods (eg LLM-as-a-judge) shed light on the scalability, but risk bias by relying on one or a few \"authority\" models. To tackle these issues, we propose Decentralized Arena (dearena), a fully automated framework leveraging collective intelligence from all LLMs to evaluate each other. It mitigates single-model judge bias by democratic, pairwise evaluation, and remains efficient at scale through two key components: (1) a coarse-to-fine ranking algorithm for fast incremental insertion of new models with sub-quadratic complexity, and (2) an automatic question selection strategy for the construction of new evaluation dimensions. Across extensive experiments across 66 LLMs, dearena attains up to 97% correlation with human judgements, while significantly reducing the cost.

        "abstract": "The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters, making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.",

Runge-Kutta (RK) methods provide a family of very powerful explicit and implicit high-order ODE solvers. However, these higher-order solvers have not found wide application in deep learning so far. In this work, we evaluate the performance of higher-order RK solvers when applied in deep learning, study their limitations, and propose ways to overcome these drawbacks.

However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.",

        "abstract": "System 2 reasoning is one of the defining characteristics of intelligence, which requires slow and logical thinking. Human conducts System 2 reasoning via the language of thoughts that organizes the reasoning process as a causal sequence of mental language, or thoughts. Recently, it has been observed that System 2 reasoning can be elicited from Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large-scale natural languages. However, in this work, we show that there is a significant gap between the modeling of languages and thoughts. As language is primarily a tool for humans to share knowledge and thinking, modeling human language can easily absorb language biases into LLMs deviated from the chain of thoughts in minds. Furthermore, we show that the biases will mislead the eliciting of \"thoughts\" in LLMs to focus only on a biased part of the premise. To this end, we propose a new prompt technique termed Language-of-Thoughts (LoT) to demonstrate and alleviate this gap. Instead of directly eliciting the chain of thoughts from partial information, LoT instructs LLMs to adjust the order and token used for the expressions of all the relevant information. We show that the simple strategy significantly reduces the language modeling biases in LLMs and improves the performance of LLMs across a variety of reasoning tasks.",

This paper introduces an adversarial evaluation framework designed to systematically stress-test the decision-making processes of LLMs under interactive and adversarial conditions. Drawing on methodologies from cognitive psychology and game theory, our framework probes how models respond in two canonical tasks: the two-armed bandit task and the Multi-Round Trust Task.

We apply this framework to several state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-1.5, and DeepSeek-V3, revealing model-specific susceptibilities to manipulation and rigidity in strategy adaptation.

Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget.

Deploying deep unfolding models such as PGD-Nets and ADMM-Nets into resource-constrained edge devices using quantization methods is challenging. Existing quantization methods based on quantization aware training (QAT) suffer from performance degradation due to their reliance on parametric distribution assumption of activations and static quantization step sizes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel kernel-based adaptive quantization (KAQ) framework for deep unfolding networks. By utilizing a joint kernel density estimation (KDE) and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) approach to align activation distributions between full-precision and quantized models, the need for prior distribution assumptions is eliminated. Additionally, a dynamic step size updating method is introduced to adjust the quantization step size based on the channel conditions of wireless networks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the accuracy of proposed KAQ framework outperforms traditional methods and successfully reduces the model's inference latency.",

This paper conducts research on UAT of DNNs with normalization layers for the first time. We theoretically prove that an infinitely wide network -- composed solely of parallel layer normalization (PLN) and linear layers -- has universal approximation capacity. Additionally, we investigate the minimum number of neurons required to approximate $L$-Lipchitz continuous functions, with a single hidden-layer network. We compare the approximation capacity of PLN with traditional activation functions in theory. Different from the traditional activation functions, we identify that PLN can act as both activation function and normalization in deep neural networks at the same time. We also find that PLN can improve the performance when replacing LN in transformer architectures, which reveals the potential of PLN used in neural architectures.",

        "abstract": "While Transformer self-attention offers strong parallelism, the Key-Value (KV) cache grows linearly with sequence length and becomes a bottleneck for inference efficiency. Multi-head latent attention was recently developed to compress the KV cache into a low-rank latent space. This paper proposes Multi-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA), which further reduces the KV cache size along the temporal dimension, greatly lowering the memory footprint of self-attention inference. MTLA employs a hyper-network to dynamically merge temporally adjacent KV cache vectors. To address the mismatch between the compressed KV cache and processed sequence lengths, a stride-aware causal mask is proposed to ensure efficient parallel training and consistency with inference behaviour. Experiments across tasks, including speech translation, speech recognition, speech understanding and text summarisation, demonstrate that MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), while greatly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage. For example, on a English-German speech translation task, MTLA achieves a 5.3x speedup and a reduction in GPU memory usage by a factor of 8.3 compared to MHA, while maintaining translation quality.",

        "abstract": "Tensor decompositions have become a central tool in data science, with applications in areas such as data analysis, signal processing, and machine learning. A key property of many tensor decompositions, such as the canonical polyadic decomposition, is identifiability: the factors are unique, up to trivial scaling and permutation ambiguities. This allows one to recover the groundtruth sources that generated the data. The Tucker decomposition (TD) is a central and widely used tensor decomposition model. However, it is in general not identifiable. In this paper, we study the identifiability of the nonnegative TD (nTD). By adapting and extending identifiability results of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), we provide uniqueness results for nTD. Our results require the nonnegative matrix factors to have some degree of sparsity (namely, satisfy the separability condition, or the sufficiently scattered condition), while the core tensor only needs to have some slices (or linear combinations of them) or unfoldings with full column rank (but does not need to be nonnegative). Under such conditions, we derive several procedures, using either unfoldings or slices of the input tensor, to obtain identifiable nTDs by minimizing the volume of unfoldings or slices of the core tensor.",

        "abstract": "The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation. However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings. Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can be trained reliably using a Depth-$\\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023; Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call \"$\\mu$PC\". Through an extensive analysis of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these instabilities, $\\mu$PC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, $\\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and depths. Our results have implications for other local algorithms and could be extended to convolutional and transformer architectures. Code for $\\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for PCNs at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc (Innocenti et al., 2024).",

        "abstract": "MZI-based block optical neural networks (BONNs), which can achieve large-scale network models, have increasingly drawn attentions. However, the robustness of the current training algorithm is not high enough. Moreover, large-scale BONNs usually contain numerous trainable parameters, resulting in expensive computation and power consumption. In this article, by pruning matrix blocks and directly optimizing the individuals in population, we propose an on-chip covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and attention-based pruning (CAP) algorithm for large-scale BONNs. The calculated results demonstrate that the CAP algorithm can prune 60% and 80% of the parameters for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively, while only degrades the performance by 3.289% and 4.693%. Considering the influence of dynamic noise in phase shifters, our proposed CAP algorithm (performance degradation of 22.327% for MNIST dataset and 24.019% for Fashion-MNIST dataset utilizing a poor fabricated chip and electrical control with a standard deviation of 0.5) exhibits strongest robustness compared with both our previously reported block adjoint training algorithm (43.963% and 41.074%) and the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (25.757% and 32.871%), respectively. Moreover, when 60% of the parameters are pruned, the CAP algorithm realizes 88.5% accuracy in experiment for the simplified MNIST dataset, which is similar to the simulation result without noise (92.1%). Additionally, we simulationally and experimentally demonstrate that using MZIs with only internal phase shifters to construct BONNs is an efficient way to reduce both the system area and the required trainable parameters. Notably, our proposed CAP algorithm show excellent potential for larger-scale network models and more complex tasks.",

        "abstract": "As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.",

However, a substantial performance gap still exists between SNN-based and ANN-based transformer architectures. While existing methods propose spiking self-attention mechanisms that are successfully combined with SNNs, the overall architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively extracting features from different image scales. In this paper, we address this issue and propose MSVIT, a novel spike-driven Transformer architecture, which firstly uses multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enrich the capability of spiking attention blocks. We validate our approach across various main data sets. The experimental results show that MSVIT outperforms existing SNN-based models, positioning itself as a state-of-the-art solution among SNN-transformer architectures.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they actually use to solve tasks, but they can also fail to do so. This suggests some degree of metacognition -- the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognitive abilities enhance AI capabilities but raise safety concerns, as models might obscure their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight mechanisms designed to detect harmful behaviors. Given society's increased reliance on these models, it is critical that we understand the limits of their metacognitive abilities, particularly their ability to monitor their internal activations. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired neurofeedback paradigm designed to quantify the ability of LLMs to explicitly report and control their activation patterns. By presenting models with sentence-label pairs where labels correspond to sentence-elicited internal activations along specific directions in the neural representation space, we demonstrate that LLMs can learn to report and control these activations. The performance varies with several factors: the number of example pairs provided, the semantic interpretability of the target neural direction, and the variance explained by that direction. These results reveal a \"metacognitive space\" with dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can monitor only a subset of their neural mechanisms. Our findings provide empirical evidence quantifying metacognitive capabilities in LLMs, with significant implications for AI safety.",
