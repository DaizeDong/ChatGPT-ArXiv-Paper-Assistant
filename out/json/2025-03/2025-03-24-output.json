        "abstract": "Offline optimization is a fundamental challenge in science and engineering, where the goal is to optimize black-box functions using only offline datasets. This setting is particularly relevant when querying the objective function is prohibitively expensive or infeasible, with applications spanning protein engineering, material discovery, neural architecture search, and beyond. The main difficulty lies in accurately estimating the objective landscape beyond the available data, where extrapolations are fraught with significant epistemic uncertainty. This uncertainty can lead to objective hacking(reward hacking), exploiting model inaccuracies in unseen regions, or other spurious optimizations that yield misleadingly high performance estimates outside the training distribution. Recent advances in model-based optimization(MBO) have harnessed the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks to develop offline-specific surrogate and generative models. Trained with carefully designed strategies, these models are more robust against out-of-distribution issues, facilitating the discovery of improved designs. Despite its growing impact in accelerating scientific discovery, the field lacks a comprehensive review. To bridge this gap, we present the first thorough review of offline MBO. We begin by formalizing the problem for both single-objective and multi-objective settings and by reviewing recent benchmarks and evaluation metrics. We then categorize existing approaches into two key areas: surrogate modeling, which emphasizes accurate function approximation in out-of-distribution regions, and generative modeling, which explores high-dimensional design spaces to identify high-performing designs. Finally, we examine the key challenges and propose promising directions for advancement in this rapidly evolving field including safe control of superintelligent systems.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the critical challenge of compressing large language models (LLMs) to facilitate their practical deployment and broader adoption. We introduce a novel post-training compression paradigm that focuses on low-rank decomposition of LLM weights. Our analysis identifies two main challenges in this task: the variability in LLM activation distributions and handling unseen activations from different datasets and models.   To address these challenges, we propose a nested activation-aware framework (NSVD) for LLMs, a training-free approach designed to enhance the accuracy of low-rank decompositions by managing activation outliers through transforming the weight matrix based on activation distribution and the original weight matrix. This method allows for the absorption of outliers into the transformed weight matrix, improving decomposition accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation across eight datasets and six models from three distinct LLM families demonstrates the superiority of NSVD over current state-of-the-art methods, especially at medium to large compression ratios or in multilingual and multitask settings.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a new framework that employs Malliavin calculus to derive explicit expressions for the score function -- i.e., the gradient of the log-density -- associated with solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our approach integrates classical integration-by-parts techniques with modern tools, such as Bismut's formula and Malliavin calculus, to address linear and nonlinear SDEs. In doing so, we establish a rigorous connection between the Malliavin derivative, its adjoint (the Malliavin divergence or the Skorokhod integral), Bismut's formula, and diffusion generative models, thus providing a systematic method for computing $\\nabla \\log p_t(x)$. For the linear case, we present a detailed study proving that our formula is equivalent to the actual score function derived from the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation for linear SDEs. Additionally, we derive a closed-form expression for $\\nabla \\log p_t(x)$ for nonlinear SDEs with state-independent diffusion coefficients. These advancements provide fresh theoretical insights into the smoothness and structure of probability densities and practical implications for score-based generative modelling, including the design and analysis of new diffusion models. Moreover, our findings promote the adoption of the robust Malliavin calculus framework in machine learning research. These results directly apply to various pure and applied mathematics fields, such as generative modelling, the study of SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion, and the Fokker--Planck equations associated with nonlinear SDEs.",

Nevertheless, the real-world data are often deviating from the UoS assumption. To address this challenge, state-of-the-art deep subspace clustering algorithms attempt to jointly learn UoS representations and self-expressive coefficients. However, the general framework of the existing algorithms suffers from a catastrophic feature collapse and lacks a theoretical guarantee to learn desired UoS representation. In this paper, we present a Principled fRamewOrk for Deep Subspace Clustering (PRO-DSC), which is designed to learn structured representations and self-expressive coefficients in a unified manner. Specifically, in PRO-DSC, we incorporate an effective regularization on the learned representations into the self-expressive model, prove that the regularized self-expressive model is able to prevent feature space collapse, and demonstrate that the learned optimal representations under certain condition lie on a union of orthogonal subspaces. Moreover, we provide a scalable and efficient approach to implement our PRO-DSC and conduct extensive experiments to verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed deep subspace clustering approach.

        "abstract": "We introduce an open-ended test grounded in algorithmic probability that can avoid benchmark contamination in the quantitative evaluation of frontier models in the context of their Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence (ASI) claims. Unlike other tests, this test does not rely on statistical compression methods (such as GZIP or LZW), which are more closely related to Shannon entropy than to Kolmogorov complexity. The test challenges aspects related to features of intelligence of fundamental nature such as synthesis and model creation in the context of inverse problems (generating new knowledge from observation). We argue that metrics based on model abstraction and optimal Bayesian inference for planning can provide a robust framework for testing intelligence, including natural intelligence (human and animal), narrow AI, AGI, and ASI. Our results show no clear evidence of LLM convergence towards a defined level of intelligence, particularly AGI or ASI. We found that LLM model versions tend to be fragile and incremental, as new versions may perform worse than older ones, with progress largely driven by the size of training data. The results were compared with a hybrid neurosymbolic approach that theoretically guarantees model convergence from optimal inference based on the principles of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity. The method outperforms LLMs in a proof-of-concept on short binary sequences. Our findings confirm suspicions regarding the fundamental limitations of LLMs, exposing them as systems optimised for the perception of mastery over human language. Progress among different LLM versions from the same developers was found to be inconsistent and limited, particularly in the absence of a solid symbolic counterpart.",

We propose a general framework for identifying latent variables in the nonparametric noisy settings. We first show that, under suitable conditions, the generative model is identifiable up to certain submanifold indeterminacies even in the presence of non-negligible noise. Furthermore, under the structural or distributional variability conditions, we prove that latent variables of the general nonlinear models are identifiable up to trivial indeterminacies. Based on the proposed theoretical framework, we have also developed corresponding estimation methods and validated them in various synthetic and real-world settings. Interestingly, our estimate of the true GDP growth from alternative measurements suggests more insightful information on the economies than official reports.

Crucially, NdLinear serves as a foundational building block for large-scale foundation models by operating on any unimodal or multimodal data in its native form. This removes the need for flattening or modality-specific preprocessing. Ndlinear rethinks core architectural priorities beyond attention, enabling more expressive, context-aware models at scale.

We introduce Gumbel-Softmax Flow and Score Matching, a generative framework on the simplex based on a novel Gumbel-Softmax interpolant with a time-dependent temperature. Using this interpolant, we introduce Gumbel-Softmax Flow Matching by deriving a parameterized velocity field that transports from smooth categorical distributions to distributions concentrated at a single vertex of the simplex. We alternatively present Gumbel-Softmax Score Matching which learns to regress the gradient of the probability density. Our framework enables high-quality, diverse generation and scales efficiently to higher-dimensional simplices. To enable training-free guidance, we propose Straight-Through Guided Flows (STGFlow), a classifier-based guidance method that leverages straight-through estimators to steer the unconditional velocity field toward optimal vertices of the simplex. STGFlow enables efficient inference-time guidance using classifiers pre-trained on clean sequences, and can be used with any discrete flow method. Together, these components form a robust framework for controllable de novo sequence generation.

However, existing token reduction techniques, such as token pruning and token merging, often disrupt essential spatial-temporal positional embeddings, failing to adequately balance computational efficiency with fewer tokens. Consequently, these methods result in relatively lengthy token sequences, limiting their applicability in scenarios requiring extreme token compression, such as video large language models. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of extreme short token reduction, aiming to represent extensive video sequences with a minimal number of tokens. To address this challenge, we propose Token Dynamics, a new video representation framework that dynamically reduces token count while preserving spatial-temporal coherence. Specifically, we disentangle video representations by separating visual embeddings from grid-level motion information, structuring them into: 1. a concise token base, created by clustering tokens that describe object-level content; 2. a token dynamics map, capturing detailed spatial-temporal motion patterns across grids. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-dynamics attention mechanism that integrates motion features into the token base without increasing token length, thereby maintaining compactness and spatial-temporal integrity. The experiments demonstrate a reduction of token count to merely 0.07% of the original tokens, with only a minor performance drop of 1.13%. Additionally, we propose two novel subtasks within extreme token reduction (fixed-length and adaptive-length compression), both effectively representing long token sequences for video-language tasks. Our method offers significantly lower theoretical complexity, fewer tokens, and enhanced throughput, thus providing an efficient solution for video LLMs.",

        "abstract": "The weights of neural networks (NNs) have recently gained prominence as a new data modality in machine learning, with applications ranging from accuracy and hyperparameter prediction to representation learning or weight generation. One approach to leverage NN weights involves training autoencoders (AEs), using contrastive and reconstruction losses. This allows such models to be applied to a wide variety of downstream tasks, and they demonstrate strong predictive performance and low reconstruction error. However, despite the low reconstruction error, these AEs reconstruct NN models with deteriorated performance compared to the original ones, limiting their usability with regard to model weight generation. In this paper, we identify a limitation of weight-space AEs, specifically highlighting that a structural loss, that uses the Euclidean distance between original and reconstructed weights, fails to capture some features critical for reconstructing high-performing models. We analyze the addition of a behavioral loss for training AEs in weight space, where we compare the output of the reconstructed model with that of the original one, given some common input. We show a strong synergy between structural and behavioral signals, leading to increased performance in all downstream tasks evaluated, in particular NN weights reconstruction and generation.",

        "title": "Ordered Topological Deep Learning: a Network Modeling Case Study",
        "abstract": "Computer networks are the foundation of modern digital infrastructure, facilitating global communication and data exchange. As demand for reliable high-bandwidth connectivity grows, advanced network modeling techniques become increasingly essential to optimize performance and predict network behavior. Traditional modeling methods, such as packet-level simulators and queueing theory, have notable limitations --either being computationally expensive or relying on restrictive assumptions that reduce accuracy. In this context, the deep learning-based RouteNet family of models has recently redefined network modeling by showing an unprecedented cost-performance trade-off. In this work, we revisit RouteNet's sophisticated design and uncover its hidden connection to Topological Deep Learning (TDL), an emerging field that models higher-order interactions beyond standard graph-based methods. We demonstrate that, although originally formulated as a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, RouteNet serves as the first instantiation of a new form of TDL. More specifically, this paper presents OrdGCCN, a novel TDL framework that introduces the notion of ordered neighbors in arbitrary discrete topological spaces, and shows that RouteNet's architecture can be naturally described as an ordered topological neural network. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful real-world application of state-of-the-art TDL principles --which we confirm through extensive testbed experiments--, laying the foundation for the next generation of ordered TDL-driven applications.",

For learnable tasks, we establish error bounds by exploiting the clustering property of the hypothesis space. Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic error for general NeSy tasks, showing that the expected error scales with the disagreement among solutions.

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have garnered considerable attention as a potential alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Recent studies have highlighted SNNs' potential on large-scale datasets. For SNN training, two main approaches exist: direct training and ANN-to-SNN (ANN2SNN) conversion. To fully leverage existing ANN models in guiding SNN learning, either direct ANN-to-SNN conversion or ANN-SNN distillation training can be employed. In this paper, we propose an ANN-SNN distillation framework from the ANN-to-SNN perspective, designed with a block-wise replacement strategy for ANN-guided learning. By generating intermediate hybrid models that progressively align SNN feature spaces to those of ANN through rate-based features, our framework naturally incorporates rate-based backpropagation as a training method. Our approach achieves results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art SNN distillation methods, showing both training and learning efficiency.",

The system uses neural-guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and supports both supervised and reinforcement learning, with a search space defined by a context-free grammar. We summarize seven desirable properties of equation discovery systems, emphasizing the importance of embedding tabular data sets for such learning approaches. Using the modular structure of MGMT, we compare seven architectures (among them, RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers) for embedding tabular datasets on the auxiliary task of contrastive learning for tabular data sets on an equation discovery task. For almost all combinations of modules, supervised learning outperforms reinforcement learning. Moreover, our experiments indicate an advantage of using grammar rules as action space instead of tokens. Two adaptations of MCTS -- risk-seeking MCTS and AmEx-MCTS -- can improve equation discovery with that kind of search.",

        "abstract": "On-device transfer learning is crucial for adapting a common backbone model to the unique environment of each edge device. Tiny microcontrollers, such as the Raspberry Pi Pico, are key targets for on-device learning but often lack floating-point units, necessitating integer-only training. Dynamic computation of quantization scale factors, which is adopted in former studies, incurs high computational costs. Therefore, this study focuses on integer-only training with static scale factors, which is challenging with existing training methods. We propose a new training method named PRIOT, which optimizes the network by pruning selected edges rather than updating weights, allowing effective training with static scale factors. The pruning pattern is determined by the edge-popup algorithm, which trains a parameter named score assigned to each edge instead of the original parameters and prunes the edges with low scores before inference. Additionally, we introduce a memory-efficient variant, PRIOT-S, which only assigns scores to a small fraction of edges. We implement PRIOT and PRIOT-S on the Raspberry Pi Pico and evaluate their accuracy and computational costs using a tiny CNN model on the rotated MNIST dataset and the VGG11 model on the rotated CIFAR-10 dataset. Our results demonstrate that PRIOT improves accuracy by 8.08 to 33.75 percentage points over existing methods, while PRIOT-S reduces memory footprint with minimal accuracy loss.",

However, masked MLE is prone to overfitting and requires self-distillation regularization to improve or maintain performance on out-of-distribution tasks. We demonstrate significant performance gain via the proposed training objective - combined masked MLE and self-distillation - across multiple architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Phi) and datasets (Alpaca, ShareGPT, GSM8K), mitigating overfitting while maintaining adaptability during post-training.

Initially trained on fixed-length sequences of 4,096 bp, our models underwent continuous pretraining to extend the context length to 192,000 bp. This iterative extension allowed for the comprehensive processing of large-scale genomic data and the capture of intricate patterns and dependencies within the human genome. Gene42 is the first dense attention model capable of handling such extensive long context lengths in genomics, challenging state-space models that often rely on convolutional operators among other mechanisms. Our pretrained models exhibit notably low perplexity values and high reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their strong ability to model genomic data.

We evaluate SafeMERGE against other fine-tuning- and post-fine-tuning-stage approaches for Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen-2-7B-Instruct models on GSM8K and PubMedQA tasks while exploring different merging strategies. We find that SafeMERGE consistently reduces harmful outputs compared to other baselines without significantly sacrificing performance, sometimes even enhancing it.

However, they offer a fundamentally connectionist and distributed approach to computing, in stark contrast to classical computers that use the von Neumann architecture. This distinction has sparked renewed interest in developing unconventional hardware to support more efficient implementations of ANNs, rather than merely emulating them on traditional systems. Photonics stands out as a particularly promising platform, providing scalability, high speed, energy efficiency, and the ability for parallel information processing. However, fully realized autonomous optical neural networks (ONNs) with in-situ learning capabilities are still rare. In this work, we demonstrate a fully autonomous and parallel ONN using a multimode vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) using off-the-shelf components. Our ONN is highly efficient and is scalable both in network size and inference bandwidth towards the GHz range. High performance hardware-compatible optimization algorithms are necessary in order to minimize reliance on external von Neumann computers to fully exploit the potential of ONNs. As such we present and extensively study several algorithms which are broadly compatible with a wide range of systems. We then apply these algorithms to optimize our ONN, and benchmark them using the MNIST dataset. We show that our ONN can achieve high accuracy and convergence efficiency, even under limited hardware resources. Crucially, we compare these different algorithms in terms of scaling and optimization efficiency in term of convergence time which is crucial when working with limited external resources.

At its core, a 2D convolution simultaneously mixes information across both the spatial and channel dimensions of a representation. Many recent computer vision architectures consist of sequences of isotropic blocks that disentangle the spatial and channel-mixing components. This separation of the operations allows us to more closely juxtapose the effects of spatial and channel mixing in deep learning. In this paper, we take an initial step towards garnering a deeper understanding of the roles of these mixing operations. Through our experiments and analysis, we discover that on both classical (ResNet) and cutting-edge (ConvMixer) models, we can reach nearly the same level of classification performance by and leaving the spatial mixers at their random initializations. Furthermore, we show that models with random, fixed spatial mixing are naturally more robust to adversarial perturbations. Lastly, we show that this phenomenon extends past the classification regime, as such models can also decode pixel-shuffled images.",
