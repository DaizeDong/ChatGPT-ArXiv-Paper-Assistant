        "abstract": "We investigate the emergence of intuitive physics understanding in general-purpose deep neural network models trained to predict masked regions in natural videos. Leveraging the violation-of-expectation framework, we find that video prediction models trained to predict outcomes in a learned representation space demonstrate an understanding of various intuitive physics properties, such as object permanence and shape consistency. In contrast, video prediction in pixel space and multimodal large language models, which reason through text, achieve performance closer to chance. Our comparisons of these architectures reveal that jointly learning an abstract representation space while predicting missing parts of sensory input, akin to predictive coding, is sufficient to acquire an understanding of intuitive physics, and that even models trained on one week of unique video achieve above chance performance. This challenges the idea that core knowledge -- a set of innate systems to help understand the world -- needs to be hardwired to develop an understanding of intuitive physics.",

        "abstract": "Bayesian and frequentist inference are two fundamental paradigms in statistical estimation. Bayesian methods treat hypotheses as random variables, incorporating priors and updating beliefs via Bayes' theorem, whereas frequentist methods assume fixed but unknown hypotheses, relying on estimators like maximum likelihood. While extensive research has compared these approaches, the frequentist paradigm of obtaining point estimates has become predominant in deep learning, as Bayesian inference is challenging due to the computational complexity and the approximation gap of posterior estimation methods. However, a good understanding of trade-offs between the two approaches is lacking in the regime of amortized estimators, where in-context learners are trained to estimate either point values via maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation, or full posteriors using normalizing flows, score-based diffusion samplers, or diagonal Gaussian approximations, conditioned on observations. To help resolve this, we conduct a rigorous comparative analysis spanning diverse problem settings, from linear models to shallow neural networks, with a robust evaluation framework assessing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization on tractable tasks. Our experiments indicate that amortized point estimators generally outperform posterior inference, though the latter remain competitive in some low-dimensional problems, and we further discuss why this might be the case.",

We present a mathematical framework to analyze self-attention matrices by deriving the structures governing their weight updates.

Our theoretical findings are validated across multiple Transformer models - including ModernBERT, GPT, LLaMA3, and Mistral - and input modalities like text, vision, and audio. Finally, we apply these insights by showing that symmetric initialization improves the performance of encoder-only models on language tasks. This mathematical analysis offers a novel theoretical perspective on how information is embedded through self-attention, thereby improving the interpretability of Transformer models.",

To address these deficiencies, we introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, we design practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.",

        "abstract": "A basic aspiration for interpretability research in large language models is to \"localize\" semantically meaningful behaviors to particular components within the LLM. There are various heuristics for finding candidate locations within the LLM. Once a candidate localization is found, it can be assessed by editing the internal representations at the corresponding localization and checking whether this induces model behavior that is consistent with the semantic interpretation of the localization. The question we address here is: how strong is the evidence provided by such edits? To assess localization, we want to assess the effect of the optimal intervention at a particular location. The key new technical tool is a way of adapting LLM alignment techniques to find such optimal localized edits. With this tool in hand, we give an example where the edit-based evidence for localization appears strong, but where localization clearly fails. Indeed, we find that optimal edits at random localizations can be as effective as aligning the full model. In aggregate, our results suggest that merely observing that localized edits induce targeted changes in behavior provides little to no evidence that these locations actually encode the target behavior.",

Yet the mechanisms underlying this contextual grounding remain unknown, especially in situations where contextual information contradicts factual knowledge stored in the parameters, which LLMs also excel at recalling. Favoring the contextual information is critical for retrieval-augmented generation methods, which enrich the context with up-to-date information, hoping that grounding can rectify outdated or noisy stored knowledge. We present a novel method to study grounding abilities using Fakepedia, a novel dataset of counterfactual texts constructed to clash with a model's internal parametric knowledge. In this study, we introduce Fakepedia, a counterfactual dataset designed to evaluate grounding abilities when the internal parametric knowledge clashes with the contextual information. We benchmark various LLMs with Fakepedia and conduct a causal mediation analysis of LLM components when answering Fakepedia queries, based on our Masked Grouped Causal Tracing (MGCT) method. Through this analysis, we identify distinct computational patterns between grounded and ungrounded responses. We finally demonstrate that distinguishing grounded from ungrounded responses is achievable through computational analysis alone. Our results, together with existing findings about factual recall mechanisms, provide a coherent narrative of how grounding and factual recall mechanisms interact within LLMs.",

Inspired by this, we view each neuron as a system and detect its multi-segment activity data under various peripheral conditions. We assume there's a time-invariant representation for the same neuron, reflecting its intrinsic properties like molecular profiles, location, and morphology. The goal of obtaining these intrinsic neuronal representations has two criteria: (I) segments from the same neuron should have more similar representations than those from different neurons; (II) the representations must generalize well to out-of-domain data. To meet these, we propose the NeurPIR (Neuron Platonic Intrinsic Representation) framework. It uses contrastive learning, with segments from the same neuron as positive pairs and those from different neurons as negative pairs. In implementation, we use VICReg, which focuses on positive pairs and separates dissimilar samples via regularization. We tested our method on Izhikevich model-simulated neuronal population dynamics data. The results accurately identified neuron types based on preset hyperparameters. We also applied it to two real-world neuron dynamics datasets with neuron type annotations from spatial transcriptomics and neuron locations. Our model's learned representations accurately predicted neuron types and locations and were robust on out-of-domain data (from unseen animals). This shows the potential of our approach for understanding neuronal systems and future neuroscience research.",

In this work, we propose AdaSplash, which combines the efficiency of GPU-optimized algorithms with the sparsity benefits of $\\alpha$-entmax. We first introduce a hybrid Halley-bisection algorithm, resulting in a 7-fold reduction in the number of iterations needed to compute the $\\alpha$-entmax transformation. Then, we implement custom Triton kernels to efficiently handle adaptive sparsity. Experiments with RoBERTa and ModernBERT for text classification and single-vector retrieval, along with GPT-2 for language modeling, show that our method achieves substantial improvements in runtime and memory efficiency compared to existing $\\alpha$-entmax implementations.

However, previous works have primarily addressed this problem from a discrete-state perspective which is not suitable as the number of network layers grows. This paper novelly treats the outputs from layers as states of a continuous process and considers leveraging the state space model (SSM) to design the aggregation of layers in very deep neural networks. Moreover, inspired by its advancements in modeling long sequences, the Selective State Space Models (S6) is employed to design a new module called Selective State Space Model Layer Aggregation (S6LA). This module aims to combine traditional CNN or transformer architectures within a sequential framework, enhancing the representational capabilities of state-of-the-art vision networks.

While speculative decoding is a widely accepted technique to accelerate autoregressive decoding, existing methods often struggle to achieve significant speedups due to inefficient KV cache optimization strategies and result in low acceptance rates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-speculative decoding framework, QuantSpec, where the draft model shares the architecture of the target model but employs a hierarchical 4-bit quantized KV cache and 4-bit quantized weights for acceleration. QuantSpec maintains high acceptance rates ($>$90%) and reliably provides consistent end-to-end speedups upto $\\sim2.5\\times$, outperforming other self-speculative decoding methods that use sparse KV cache for long-context LLM inference. QuantSpec also reduces the memory requirements by $\\sim 1.3\\times$ compared to these alternatives.",

We address this issue through the lens of knowledge circuit evolution, identifying computational subgraphs that facilitate knowledge storage and processing. Our systematic analysis of circuit evolution throughout continual pre-training reveals several key findings: (1) the acquisition of new knowledge is influenced by its relevance to pre-existing knowledge; (2) the evolution of knowledge circuits exhibits a distinct phase shift from formation to optimization; (3) the evolution of knowledge circuits follows a deep-to-shallow pattern. These insights not only advance our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of new knowledge acquisition in LLMs, but also provide potential implications for improving continual pre-training strategies to enhance model performance.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their capabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference. However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a sequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable. These subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their current state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless transitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state. This iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching directly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions between question states. Furthermore, these atomic questions can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling AoT to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AoT both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, AoT achieves an 80.6% F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by 3.4% and DeepSeek-R1 by 10.6%.

This allows us to apply the precision level suitable to distinct components within the model, ensuring that multi-head attention and linear layers are handled appropriately. Our pretraining recipe ensures stability in backpropagation by incorporating fine-grained quantization methods with a target precision training schedule. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 training scheme achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with smaller theoretical computational cost.

Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they continue to face challenges with CF during continual learning. The majority of existing research focuses on analyzing forgetting patterns through a singular training sequence, thereby overlooking the intricate effects that diverse tasks have on model behavior. Our study explores CF across various settings, discovering that model forgetting is influenced by both the specific training tasks and the models themselves. To this end, we interpret forgetting by examining the function vector (FV), a compact representation of functions in LLMs, offering a model-dependent indicator for the occurrence of CF. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrated that CF in LLMs primarily stems from biases in function activation rather than the overwriting of task processing functions. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel function vector guided training methodology, incorporating a regularization technique to stabilize the FV and mitigate forgetting. Empirical tests on four benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed training method, substantiating our theoretical framework concerning CF and model function dynamics.

In this work, we develop a new SFT framework, based on ideas from neural network pruning.

To derive these importance weights, we introduce a set of Radon-Nikodym derivatives of CTMCs over their path measures. Because the computation of these weights is intractable with standard neural network parameterizations of rate matrices, we devise a new compact representation for rate matrices via what we call locally equivariant functions. To parameterize them, we introduce a family of locally equivariant multilayer perceptrons, attention layers, and convolutional networks, and provide an approach to make deep networks that preserve the local equivariance. This property allows us to propose a scalable training algorithm for the rate matrix such that the variance of the importance weights associated to the CTMC are minimal.

        "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a critical challenge in graph learning, as real-world graph data often exhibit diverse and shifting environments that traditional models fail to generalize across. A promising solution to address this issue is graph invariant learning (GIL), which aims to learn invariant representations by disentangling label-correlated invariant subgraphs from environment-specific subgraphs. However, existing GIL methods face two major challenges: (1) the difficulty of capturing and modeling diverse environments in graph data, and (2) the semantic cliff, where invariant subgraphs from different classes are difficult to distinguish, leading to poor class separability and increased misclassifications. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Multi-Prototype Hyperspherical Invariant Learning (MPHIL), which introduces two key innovations: (1) hyperspherical invariant representation extraction, enabling robust and highly discriminative hyperspherical invariant feature extraction, and (2) multi-prototype hyperspherical classification, which employs class prototypes as intermediate variables to eliminate the need for explicit environment modeling in GIL and mitigate the semantic cliff issue. Derived from the theoretical framework of GIL, we introduce two novel objective functions: the invariant prototype matching loss to ensure samples are matched to the correct class prototypes, and the prototype separation loss to increase the distinction between prototypes of different classes in the hyperspherical space. Extensive experiments on 11 OOD generalization benchmark datasets demonstrate that MPHIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods across graph data from various domains and with different distribution shifts.",

        "abstract": "Despite a strong theoretical foundation, empirical experiments reveal that existing domain generalization (DG) algorithms often fail to consistently outperform the ERM baseline. We argue that this issue arises because most DG studies focus on establishing theoretical guarantees for generalization under unrealistic assumptions, such as the availability of sufficient, diverse (or even infinite) domains or access to target domain knowledge. As a result, the extent to which domain generalization is achievable in scenarios with limited domains remains largely unexplored. This paper seeks to address this gap by examining generalization through the lens of the conditions necessary for its existence and learnability. Specifically, we systematically establish a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for generalization. Our analysis highlights that existing DG methods primarily act as regularization mechanisms focused on satisfying sufficient conditions, while often neglecting necessary ones. However, sufficient conditions cannot be verified in settings with limited training domains. In such cases, regularization targeting sufficient conditions aims to maximize the likelihood of generalization, whereas regularization targeting necessary conditions ensures its existence. Using this analysis, we reveal the shortcomings of existing DG algorithms by showing that, while they promote sufficient conditions, they inadvertently violate necessary conditions. To validate our theoretical insights, we propose a practical method that promotes the sufficient condition while maintaining the necessary conditions through a novel subspace representation alignment strategy. This approach highlights the advantages of preserving the necessary conditions on well-established DG benchmarks.",

To further enhance its efficiency and accuracy, we design an advanced neural network architecture that integrates random Fourier features as coordinate embeddings, employs a modified multi-layer perceptron as the primary backbone, and enforces hard constraints in the output layer. This framework is benchmarked through simulations of corrosion problems with multiple pits, where the staggered training scheme and network architecture significantly improve both the efficiency and accuracy of PINNs.

        "abstract": "We present a method leveraging extreme learning machine (ELM) type randomized neural networks (NNs) for learning the exact time integration algorithm for initial value problems (IVPs). The exact time integration algorithm for non-autonomous systems can be represented by an algorithmic function in higher dimensions, which satisfies an associated system of partial differential equations with corresponding boundary conditions. Our method learns the algorithmic function by solving this associated system using ELM with a physics informed approach. The trained ELM network serves as the learned algorithm and can be used to solve the IVP with arbitrary initial data or step sizes from some domain. When the right hand side of the non-autonomous system exhibits a periodicity with respect to any of its arguments, while the solution itself to the problem is not periodic, we show that the algorithmic function is either periodic, or when it is not, satisfies a well-defined relation for different periods. This property can greatly simplify the algorithm learning in many problems. We consider explicit and implicit NN formulations, leading to explicit or implicit time integration algorithms, and discuss how to train the ELM network by the nonlinear least squares method. Extensive numerical experiments with benchmark problems, including non-stiff, stiff and chaotic systems, show that the learned NN algorithm produces highly accurate solutions in long-time simulations, with its time-marching errors decreasing nearly exponentially with increasing degrees of freedom in the neural network. We compare extensively the computational performance (accuracy vs.~cost) between the current NN algorithm and the leading traditional time integration algorithms. The learned NN algorithm is computationally competitive, markedly outperforming the traditional algorithms in many problems.",

        "abstract": "The recent advancement of foundation models (FMs) has brought about a paradigm shift, revolutionizing various sectors worldwide. The popular optimizers used to train these models are stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms, which face inherent limitations, such as slow convergence and stringent assumptions for convergence. In particular, data heterogeneity arising from distributed settings poses significant challenges to their theoretical and numerical performance. This paper develops an algorithm, PISA ({P}reconditioned {I}nexact {S}tochastic {A}lternating Direction Method of Multipliers), which enables scalable parallel computing and supports various second-moment schemes. Grounded in rigorous theoretical guarantees, the algorithm converges under the sole assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient, thereby removing the need for other conditions commonly imposed by stochastic methods. This capability enables PISA to tackle the challenge of data heterogeneity effectively. Comprehensive experimental evaluations for training or fine-tuning diverse FMs, including vision models, large language models, reinforcement learning models, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks, demonstrate its superior numerical performance compared to various state-of-the-art optimizers.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we ask: what truly determines the effectiveness of RL training data for enhancing language models' reasoning capabilities? While recent advances like o1, Deepseek R1, and Kimi1.5 demonstrate RL's potential, the lack of transparency about training data requirements has hindered systematic progress. Starting directly from base models without distillation, we challenge the assumption that scaling up RL training data inherently improves performance. we demonstrate that a strategically selected subset of just 1,389 samples can outperform the full 8,523-sample dataset. We introduce Learning Impact Measurement (LIM), an automated method to evaluate and prioritize training samples based on their alignment with model learning trajectories, enabling efficient resource utilization and scalable implementation. Our method achieves comparable or even superior performance using only 1,389 samples versus the full 8,523 samples dataset. Notably, while recent data-efficient approaches (e.g., LIMO and s1) show promise with 32B-scale models, we find it significantly underperforms at 7B-scale through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In contrast, our RL-based LIMR achieves 16.7% higher accuracy on AIME24 and outperforms LIMO and s1 by 13.0% and 22.2% on MATH500. These results fundamentally reshape our understanding of RL scaling in LLMs, demonstrating that precise sample selection, rather than data scale, may be the key to unlocking enhanced reasoning capabilities. For reproducible research and future innovation, we are open-sourcing LIMR, including implementation of LIM, training and evaluation code, curated datasets, and trained models at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMR.",

For instance, an extensive focus on optimizing target metrics, while neglecting rigorous standardized evaluation, has led researchers to pursue ad-hoc heuristic defenses that were seemingly effective. Yet, most of these were exposed as flawed by subsequent evaluations, ultimately contributing little measurable progress to the field. In this position paper, we illustrate that current research on the robustness of large language models (LLMs) risks repeating past patterns with potentially worsened real-world implications. To address this, we argue that realigned objectives are necessary for meaningful progress in adversarial alignment. To this end, we build on established cybersecurity taxonomy to formally define differences between past and emerging threat models that apply to LLMs. Using this framework, we illustrate that progress requires disentangling adversarial alignment into addressable sub-problems and returning to core academic principles, such as measureability, reproducibility, and comparability. Although the field presents significant challenges, the fresh start on adversarial robustness offers the unique opportunity to build on past experience while avoiding previous mistakes.",

(ii) Despite the predefined classes, new types of anomalies can occur during production that require to be detected accurately. (iii) Anomalous data is rare in manufacturing processes, leading to limited data for model learning. To tackle the above challenges simultaneously, this paper proposes a novel deep subspace learning-based 3D anomaly classification model. Specifically, starting from a lightweight encoder to extract the latent representations, we model each class as a subspace to account for the intra-class variation, while promoting distinct subspaces of different classes to tackle the inter-class similarity. Moreover, the explicit modeling of subspaces offers the capability to detect out-of-distribution samples, i.e., new types of anomalies, and the regularization effect with much fewer learnable parameters of our proposed subspace classifier, compared to the popular Multi-Layer Perceptions (MLPs). Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate our method achieves better anomaly classification results than benchmark methods, and can effectively identify the new types of anomalies.",

Time series data is represented by some representative samples, called atoms, via dictionary learning. The useful samples are selected based on their correlation with the atoms. The method is tested on one simulated dataset and two benchmark datasets.

However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs? In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks. For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points. We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models. Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression. They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.",

We hypothesize that the wide range of rotation angles may prevent LLMs from utilizing those dimensions.

The model's ability to retain old tasks is referred to as stability, while its adaptability to new tasks is called plasticity. Therefore, the key to solving this problem is to find a trade-off between the plasticity and stability of the model. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel method to achieve a balance between model stability and plasticity, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. More specifically, our proposed approach leverages parameter isolation and a subsequent combination strategy. Initially, in the training stage, the model adapts to each downstream task via a parameter isolation method to prevent potential interference among different tasks. We then combine all trained parameters, which contain acquired knowledge, using the task arithmetic method and finally apply them to the backbone model. Empirical evaluations on continual language learning benchmarks substantiate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing a marked enhancement over existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

Moreover, even using exhaustive search, reliably identifying optimal prompts from practical neural predictors can be difficult. Further, we demonstrate that common prompting methods, such as using intuitive prompts or samples from the targeted task, are in fact suboptimal.

        "abstract": "Instruction Fine-tuning (IFT) can enhance the helpfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs), but it may lower their truthfulness. This trade-off arises because IFT steers LLMs to generate responses with long-tail knowledge that is not well covered during pre-training, leading to more informative but less truthful answers when generalizing to unseen tasks. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate this helpfulness-truthfulness trade-off in IFT and propose $\\textbf{UNIT}$, a novel IFT paradigm to address it. UNIT teaches LLMs to recognize their uncertainty and explicitly reflect it at the end of their responses. Experimental results show that UNIT-tuned models maintain their helpfulness while distinguishing between certain and uncertain claims, thereby reducing hallucinations.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) often exhibit biases toward certain categories during object recognition, even under balanced training data conditions. The intrinsic mechanisms underlying these biases remain unclear. Inspired by the human visual system, which decouples object manifolds through hierarchical processing to achieve object recognition, we propose a geometric analysis framework linking the geometric complexity of class-specific perceptual manifolds in DNNs to model bias. Our findings reveal that differences in geometric complexity can lead to varying recognition capabilities across categories, introducing biases. To support this analysis, we present the Perceptual-Manifold-Geometry library, designed for calculating the geometric properties of perceptual manifolds.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous machine learning systems that learn many tasks in sequence are prone to the catastrophic forgetting problem. Mathematical theory is needed in order to understand the extent of forgetting during continual learning. As a foundational step towards this goal, we study continual learning and catastrophic forgetting from a theoretical perspective in the simple setting of gradient descent with no explicit algorithmic mechanism to prevent forgetting. In this setting, we analytically demonstrate that overparameterization alone can mitigate forgetting in the context of a linear regression model. We consider a two-task setting motivated by permutation tasks, and show that as the overparameterization ratio becomes sufficiently high, a model trained on both tasks in sequence results in a low-risk estimator for the first task. As part of this work, we establish a non-asymptotic bound of the risk of a single linear regression task, which may be of independent interest to the field of double descent theory.",

        "abstract": "We study the task of Multiclass Linear Classification (MLC) in the distribution-free PAC model with Random Classification Noise (RCN). Specifically, the learner is given a set of labeled examples $(x, y)$, where $x$ is drawn from an unknown distribution on $R^d$ and the labels are generated by a multiclass linear classifier corrupted with RCN. That is, the label $y$ is flipped from $i$ to $j$ with probability $H_{ij}$ according to a known noise matrix $H$ with non-negative separation $\\sigma: = \\min_{i \\neq j} H_{ii}-H_{ij}$. The goal is to compute a hypothesis with small 0-1 error. For the special case of two labels, prior work has given polynomial-time algorithms achieving the optimal error. Surprisingly, little is known about the complexity of this task even for three labels. As our main contribution, we show that the complexity of MLC with RCN becomes drastically different in the presence of three or more labels. Specifically, we prove super-polynomial Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds for this problem. In more detail, even for three labels and constant separation, we give a super-polynomial lower bound on the complexity of any SQ algorithm achieving optimal error. For a larger number of labels and smaller separation, we show a super-polynomial SQ lower bound even for the weaker goal of achieving any constant factor approximation to the optimal loss or even beating the trivial hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "Advances in deep learning and representation learning have transformed item factor analysis (IFA) in the item response theory (IRT) literature by enabling more efficient and accurate parameter estimation. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been one of the most impactful techniques in modeling high-dimensional latent variables in this context. However, the limited expressiveness of the inference model based on traditional VAEs can still hinder the estimation performance. This study introduces Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) algorithms as an improvement to VAEs for IFA with improved flexibility and accuracy. By bridging the strengths of VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AVB incorporates an auxiliary discriminator network to reframe the estimation process as a two-player adversarial game and removes the restrictive assumption of standard normal distributions in the inference model. Theoretically, AVB can achieve similar or higher likelihood compared to VAEs. A further enhanced algorithm, Importance-weighted Adversarial Variational Bayes (IWAVB) is proposed and compared with Importance-weighted Autoencoders (IWAE). In an exploratory analysis of real empirical data, IWAVB demonstrated superior expressiveness by achieving a higher likelihood compared to IWAE. In confirmatory studies with simulated data, IWAVB achieved similar mean-square error results to IWAE while consistently achieving higher likelihoods. Moreover, in simulations where latent variables followed a multimodal distribution, IWAVB outperformed IWAE by providing more accurate parameter estimates. With its innovative use of GANs, IWAVB is shown to have the potential to extend IFA to handle large-scale data, facilitating the potential integration of psychometrics and multimodal data analysis.",

        "abstract": "Restricted kernel machines (RKMs) have demonstrated a significant impact in enhancing generalization ability in the field of machine learning. Recent studies have introduced various methods within the RKM framework, combining kernel functions with the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) in a manner similar to the energy function of restricted boltzmann machines (RBM), such that a better performance can be achieved. However, RKM's efficacy can be compromised by the presence of outliers and other forms of contamination within the dataset. These anomalies can skew the learning process, leading to less accurate and reliable outcomes. To address this critical issue and to ensure the robustness of the model, we propose the novel one-class RKM (OCRKM). In the framework of OCRKM, we employ an energy function akin to that of the RBM, which integrates both visible and hidden variables in a nonprobabilistic setting. The formulation of the proposed OCRKM facilitates the seamless integration of one-class classification method with the RKM, enhancing its capability to detect outliers and anomalies effectively. The proposed OCRKM model is evaluated over UCI benchmark datasets. Experimental findings and statistical analyses consistently emphasize the superior generalization capabilities of the proposed OCRKM model over baseline models across all scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Reduced Order Modeling is of paramount importance for efficiently inferring high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields in parametric contexts, enabling computationally tractable parametric analyses, uncertainty quantification and control. However, conventional dimensionality reduction techniques are typically limited to known and constant parameters, inefficient for nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and uninformed to the actual system behavior. In this work, we propose sensor-driven SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks for Reduced Order Modeling (SHRED-ROM). Specifically, we consider the composition of a long short-term memory network, which encodes the temporal dynamics of limited sensor data in multiple scenarios, and a shallow decoder, which reconstructs the corresponding high-dimensional states. SHRED-ROM is a robust decoding-only strategy that circumvents the numerically unstable approximation of an inverse which is required by encoding-decoding schemes. To enhance computational efficiency and memory usage, the full-order state snapshots are reduced by, e.g., proper orthogonal decomposition, allowing for compressive training of the networks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. Through applications on chaotic and nonlinear fluid dynamics, we show that SHRED-ROM (i) accurately reconstructs the state dynamics for new parameter values starting from limited fixed or mobile sensors, independently on sensor placement, (ii) can cope with both physical, geometrical and time-dependent parametric dependencies, while being agnostic to their actual values, (iii) can accurately estimate unknown parameters, and (iv) can deal with different data sources, such as high-fidelity simulations, coupled fields and videos.",

        "abstract": "The application of large language models (LLMs) to graph data has attracted a lot of attention recently. LLMs allow us to use deep contextual embeddings from pretrained models in text-attributed graphs, where shallow embeddings are often used for the text at- tributes of nodes. However, it is still challenging to efficiently en- code the graph structure and features into a sequential form for use by LLMs. In addition, the performance of an LLM alone, is highly dependent on the structure of the input prompt, which limits their effectiveness as a reliable approach and often requires iterative man- ual adjustments that could be slow, tedious and difficult to replicate programmatically. In this paper, we propose GraphiT (Graphs in Text), a framework for encoding graphs into a textual format and optimizing LLM prompts for graph prediction tasks. Here we focus on node classification for text-attributed graphs. We encode the graph data for every node and its neighborhood into a concise text to enable LLMs to better utilize the information in the graph. We then further programmatically optimize the LLM prompts us- ing the DSPy framework to automate this step and make it more efficient and reproducible. GraphiT outperforms our LLM-based baselines on three datasets and we show how the optimization step in GraphiT leads to measurably better results without manual prompt tweaking. We also demonstrated that our graph encoding approach is competitive to other graph encoding methods while being less expensive because it uses significantly less tokens for the same task.",
