## 1. [Beyond Standard MoE: Mixture of Latent Experts for Resource-Efficient Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23100) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23100

**Authors:** Zehua Liu, Han Wu, Ruifeng She, Xiaojin Fu, Xiongwei Han, Tao Zhong, Mingxuan Yuan

**Abstract:** Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a pivotal architectural paradigm for efficient scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), operating through selective activation of parameter subsets for each input token. Nevertheless, conventional MoE architectures encounter substantial challenges, including excessive memory utilization and communication overhead during training and inference, primarily attributable to the proliferation of expert modules. In this paper, we introduce Mixture of Latent Experts (MoLE), a novel parameterization methodology that facilitates the mapping of specific experts into a shared latent space. Specifically, all expert operations are systematically decomposed into two principal components: a shared projection into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by expert-specific transformations with significantly reduced parametric complexity. This factorized approach substantially diminishes parameter count and computational requirements. Beyond the pretraining implementation of the MoLE architecture, we also establish a rigorous mathematical framework for transforming pre-trained MoE models into the MoLE architecture, characterizing the sufficient conditions for optimal factorization and developing a systematic two-phase algorithm for this conversion process. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrates that MoLE significantly enhances computational efficiency across multiple dimensions while preserving model representational capacity. Empirical evaluations corroborate our theoretical findings, confirming that MoLE achieves performance comparable to standard MoE implementations while substantially reducing resource requirements.

**Comment:** The paper introduces Mixture of Latent Experts (MoLE), a novel parameterization for MoE architectures, addressing computational efficiency and memory challenges. This aligns closely with the 'Model Architecture' and 'Model Compression' criteria.

## 2. [NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Back-propagation or Forward-propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24322) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.24322

**Authors:** Qinyu Li, Yee Whye Teh, Razvan Pascanu

**Abstract:** The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a gradient term at each layer by back-propagating the error signal from the output towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural networks, where each layer builds on the representation of the layer below, this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features live on the top layers of the model, while features on lower layers are expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, where each layer independently learns to denoise a noisy target. We believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of gradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each layer beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable learning algorithm which achieves superior accuracy, is easier to use and computationally more efficient compared to other existing back-propagation-free methods. By departing from the traditional gradient based learning paradigm, NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other characteristics of the learning process.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a gradient-free learning method (NoProp) that departs from traditional backpropagation, offering a novel perspective on training dynamics.

## 3. [The Reasoning-Memorization Interplay in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23084) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23084

**Authors:** Yihuai Hong, Dian Zhou, Meng Cao, Lei Yu, Zhijing Jin

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel on a variety of reasoning benchmarks, but previous studies suggest they sometimes struggle to generalize to unseen questions, potentially due to over-reliance on memorized training examples. However, the precise conditions under which LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization during text generation remain unclear. In this work, we provide a mechanistic understanding of LLMs' reasoning-memorization dynamics by identifying a set of linear features in the model's residual stream that govern the balance between genuine reasoning and memory recall. These features not only distinguish reasoning tasks from memory-intensive ones but can also be manipulated to causally influence model performance on reasoning tasks. Additionally, we show that intervening in these reasoning features helps the model more accurately activate the most relevant problem-solving capabilities during answer generation. Our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of reasoning and memory in LLMs and pave the way for the development of more robust and interpretable generative AI systems.

**Comment:** The paper provides mechanistic insights into reasoning and memorization dynamics in LLMs, which aligns with the foundational research on LLM behavior and interpretability.

## 4. [TransMamba: Flexibly Switching between Transformer and Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24067) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.24067

**Authors:** Yixing Li, Ruobing Xie, Zhen Yang, Xingwu Sun, Shuaipeng Li, Weidong Han, Zhanhui Kang, Yu Cheng, Chengzhong Xu, Di Wang, Jie Jiang

**Abstract:** Transformers are the cornerstone of modern large language models, but their quadratic computational complexity limits efficiency in long-sequence processing. Recent advancements in Mamba, a state space model (SSM) with linear complexity, offer promising efficiency gains but suffer from unstable contextual learning and multitask generalization. This paper proposes TransMamba, a novel framework that unifies Transformer and Mamba through shared parameter matrices (e.g., QKV and CBx), and thus could dynamically switch between attention and SSM mechanisms at different token lengths and layers. We design the Memory converter to bridge Transformer and Mamba by converting attention outputs into SSM-compatible states, ensuring seamless information flow at TransPoints where the transformation happens. The TransPoint scheduling is also thoroughly explored for further improvements. We conducted extensive experiments demonstrating that TransMamba achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to baselines, and validated the deeper consistency between Transformer and Mamba paradigms, offering a scalable solution for next-generation sequence modeling.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a hybrid framework combining Transformers and Mamba, which aligns with model architecture innovations and explores dynamic switching mechanisms.

## 5. [Boosting Large Language Models with Mask Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22764) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.22764

**Authors:** Mingyuan Zhang, Yue Bai, Huan Wang, Yizhou Wang, Qihua Dong, Yun Fu

**Abstract:** The model is usually kept integral in the mainstream large language model (LLM) fine-tuning protocols. No works have questioned whether maintaining the integrity of the model is indispensable for performance. In this work, we introduce Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT), a brand-new LLM fine-tuning paradigm to show that properly breaking the integrity of the model can surprisingly lead to improved performance. Specifically, MFT learns a set of binary masks supervised by the typical LLM fine-tuning objective. Extensive experiments show that MFT gains a consistent performance boost across various domains and backbones (e.g., 1.95%/1.88% average gain in coding with LLaMA2-7B/3.1-8B). Detailed procedures are provided to study the proposed MFT from different hyperparameter perspectives for better insight. In particular, MFT naturally updates the current LLM training protocol by deploying it on a complete well-trained model. This study extends the functionality of mask learning from its conventional network pruning context for model compression to a more general scope.

**Comment:** The paper introduces Mask Fine-Tuning for LLMs, which aligns with foundational research in large language models and explores a novel fine-tuning paradigm.

## 6. [SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24358) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.24358

**Authors:** Hao Wang, Ligong Han, Kai Xu, Akash Srivastava

**Abstract:** The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel KV cache quantization method (SQuat) with a theoretical framework, aligning with the model compression criterion.

## 7. [Towards Understanding the Optimization Mechanisms in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23016) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23016

**Authors:** Binchuan Qi, Wei Gong, Li Li

**Abstract:** In this paper, we adopt a probability distribution estimation perspective to explore the optimization mechanisms of supervised classification using deep neural networks. We demonstrate that, when employing the Fenchel-Young loss, despite the non-convex nature of the fitting error with respect to the model's parameters, global optimal solutions can be approximated by simultaneously minimizing both the gradient norm and the structural error. The former can be controlled through gradient descent algorithms. For the latter, we prove that it can be managed by increasing the number of parameters and ensuring parameter independence, thereby providing theoretical insights into mechanisms such as over-parameterization and random initialization. Ultimately, the paper validates the key conclusions of the proposed method through empirical results, illustrating its practical effectiveness.

**Comment:** The paper provides theoretical insights into optimization mechanisms in deep learning, aligning with representation learning and training dynamics.

## 8. [MoRE-LLM: Mixture of Rule Experts Guided by a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22731) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.22731

**Authors:** Alexander Koebler, Ingo Thon, Florian Buettner

**Abstract:** To ensure the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI systems, it is essential to align machine learning models with human domain knowledge. This can be a challenging and time-consuming endeavor that requires close communication between data scientists and domain experts. Recent leaps in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can help alleviate this burden. In this paper, we propose a Mixture of Rule Experts guided by a Large Language Model (MoRE-LLM) which combines a data-driven black-box model with knowledge extracted from an LLM to enable domain knowledge-aligned and transparent predictions. While the introduced Mixture of Rule Experts (MoRE) steers the discovery of local rule-based surrogates during training and their utilization for the classification task, the LLM is responsible for enhancing the domain knowledge alignment of the rules by correcting and contextualizing them. Importantly, our method does not rely on access to the LLM during test time and ensures interpretability while not being prone to LLM-based confabulations. We evaluate our method on several tabular data sets and compare its performance with interpretable and non-interpretable baselines. Besides performance, we evaluate our grey-box method with respect to the utilization of interpretable rules. In addition to our quantitative evaluation, we shed light on how the LLM can provide additional context to strengthen the comprehensibility and trustworthiness of the model's reasoning process.

**Comment:** The paper introduces MoRE-LLM, a mixture of rule experts guided by LLMs, which aligns with 'Model Architecture' through its novel combination of rule-based and data-driven methods.

## 9. [TRA: Better Length Generalisation with Threshold Relative Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23174) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23174

**Authors:** Mattia Opper, Roland Fernandez, Paul Smolensky, Jianfeng Gao

**Abstract:** Transformers struggle with length generalisation, displaying poor performance even on basic tasks. We test whether these limitations can be explained through two key failures of the self-attention mechanism. The first is the inability to fully remove irrelevant information. The second is tied to position, even if the dot product between a key and query is highly negative (i.e. an irrelevant key) learned positional biases may unintentionally up-weight such information - dangerous when distances become out of distribution. Put together, these two failure cases lead to compounding generalisation difficulties. We test whether they can be mitigated through the combination of a) selective sparsity - completely removing irrelevant keys from the attention softmax and b) contextualised relative distance - distance is only considered as between the query and the keys that matter. We show how refactoring the attention mechanism with these two mitigations in place can substantially improve generalisation capabilities of decoder only transformers.

**Comment:** The paper introduces modifications to the attention mechanism in transformers, specifically addressing sparsity and positional biases, which aligns with architectural innovations.

## 10. [Model Hemorrhage and the Robustness Limits of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23924) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23924

**Authors:** Ziyang Ma, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Gui-Song Xia, Bo Du, Liangpei Zhang, Dacheng Tao

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across natural language processing tasks, yet undergo significant performance degradation when modified for deployment through quantization, pruning, or decoding strategy adjustments. We define this phenomenon as model hemorrhage - performance decline caused by parameter alterations and architectural changes. Through systematic analysis of various LLM frameworks, we identify key vulnerability patterns: layer expansion frequently disrupts attention mechanisms, compression techniques induce information loss cascades, and decoding adjustments amplify prediction divergences. Our investigation reveals transformer architectures exhibit inherent robustness thresholds that determine hemorrhage severity across modification types. We propose three mitigation strategies: gradient-aware pruning preserves critical weight pathways, dynamic quantization scaling maintains activation integrity, and decoding calibration aligns generation trajectories with original model distributions. This work establishes foundational metrics for evaluating model stability during adaptation, providing practical guidelines for maintaining performance while enabling efficient LLM deployment. Our findings advance understanding of neural network resilience under architectural transformations, particularly for large-scale language models.

**Comment:** The paper investigates robustness limits of LLMs under compression techniques like pruning and quantization, providing insights into model stability and resilience.

## 11. [Mixture of Routers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23362) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23362

**Authors:** Jia-Chen Zhang, Yu-Jie Xiong, Xi-He Qiu, Chun-Ming Xia, Fei Dai

**Abstract:** Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a milestone in aligning large language models with human instructions and adapting them to downstream tasks. In particular, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained widespread attention due to its parameter efficiency. However, its impact on improving the performance of large models remains limited. Recent studies suggest that combining LoRA with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can significantly enhance fine-tuning performance. MoE adapts to the diversity and complexity of datasets by dynamically selecting the most suitable experts, thereby improving task accuracy and efficiency. Despite impressive results, recent studies reveal issues in the MoE routing mechanism, such as incorrect assignments and imbalanced expert allocation. Inspired by the principles of Redundancy and Fault Tolerance Theory. We innovatively integrate the concept of Mixture of Experts into the routing mechanism and propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Mixture of Routers (MoR). It employs multiple sub-routers for joint selection and uses a learnable main router to determine the weights of the sub-routers. The results show that MoR outperforms baseline models on most tasks, achieving an average performance improvement of 1%. MoR can serve as a plug-and-play, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method suitable for a wide range of applications. Our code is available here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoR-DFC6.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel fine-tuning method integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with a new routing mechanism, which directly aligns with the 'Model Architecture' criterion.

## 12. [KernelDNA: Dynamic Kernel Sharing via Decoupled Naive Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23379) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23379

**Authors:** Haiduo Huang, Yadong Zhang, Pengju Ren

**Abstract:** Dynamic convolution enhances model capacity by adaptively combining multiple kernels, yet faces critical trade-offs: prior works either (1) incur significant parameter overhead by scaling kernel numbers linearly, (2) compromise inference speed through complex kernel interactions, or (3) struggle to jointly optimize dynamic attention and static kernels. We also observe that pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit inter-layer redundancy akin to that in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, dense convolutional layers can be efficiently replaced by derived ``child" layers generated from a shared ``parent" convolutional kernel through an adapter.   To address these limitations and implement the weight-sharing mechanism, we propose a lightweight convolution kernel plug-in, named KernelDNA. It decouples kernel adaptation into input-dependent dynamic routing and pre-trained static modulation, ensuring both parameter efficiency and hardware-friendly inference. Unlike existing dynamic convolutions that expand parameters via multi-kernel ensembles, our method leverages cross-layer weight sharing and adapter-based modulation, enabling dynamic kernel specialization without altering the standard convolution structure. This design preserves the native computational efficiency of standard convolutions while enhancing representation power through input-adaptive kernel adjustments. Experiments on image classification and dense prediction tasks demonstrate that KernelDNA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency balance among dynamic convolution variants. Our codes are available at https://github.com/haiduo/KernelDNA.

**Comment:** The paper proposes KernelDNA, a novel dynamic convolution method leveraging weight sharing and adapters, which aligns with the 'Model Compression' and 'Model Architecture' criteria.

## 13. [Evaluating and Designing Sparse Autoencoders by Approximating Quasi-Orthogonality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24277) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.24277

**Authors:** Sewoong Lee, Adam Davies, Marc E. Canby, Julia Hockenmaier

**Abstract:** Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a workhorse of modern mechanistic interpretability, but leading SAE approaches with top-$k$ style activation functions lack theoretical grounding for selecting the hyperparameter $k$. SAEs are based on the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which assumes that the representations of large language models (LLMs) are linearly encoded, and the superposition hypothesis (SH), which states that there can be more features in the model than its dimensionality. We show that, based on the formal definitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the latent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be approximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error bound. To visualize this, we propose the ZF plot, which reveals a previously unknown relationship between LLM hidden embeddings and SAE feature vectors, allowing us to make the first empirical measurement of the extent to which feature vectors of pre-trained SAEs are over- or under-activated for a given input. Correspondingly, we introduce Approximate Feature Activation (AFA), which approximates the magnitude of the ground-truth sparse feature vector, and propose a new evaluation metric derived from AFA to assess the alignment between inputs and activations. We also leverage AFA to introduce a novel SAE architecture, the top-AFA SAE, leading to SAEs that: (a) are more in line with theoretical justifications; and (b) obviate the need to tune SAE sparsity hyperparameters. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that top-AFA SAEs achieve reconstruction loss comparable to that of state-of-the-art top-k SAEs, without requiring the hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned. Our code is available at: https://github.com/SewoongLee/top-afa-sae.

## 14. [AirCache: Activating Inter-modal Relevancy KV Cache Compression for Efficient Large Vision-Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23956) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23956

**Authors:** Kai Huang, Hao Zou, Bochen Wang, Ye Xi, Zhen Xie, Hao Wang

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

**Comment:** The paper proposes AirCache, a KV cache compression method for LVLMs, which aligns with the 'Model Compression' criterion.

## 15. [GMapLatent: Geometric Mapping in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23407) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23407

**Authors:** Wei Zeng, Xuebin Chang, Jianghao Su, Xiang Gu, Jian Sun, Zongben Xu

**Abstract:** Cross-domain generative models based on encoder-decoder AI architectures have attracted much attention in generating realistic images, where domain alignment is crucial for generation accuracy. Domain alignment methods usually deal directly with the initial distribution; however, mismatched or mixed clusters can lead to mode collapse and mixture problems in the decoder, compromising model generalization capabilities. In this work, we innovate a cross-domain alignment and generation model that introduces a canonical latent space representation based on geometric mapping to align the cross-domain latent spaces in a rigorous and precise manner, thus avoiding mode collapse and mixture in the encoder-decoder generation architectures. We name this model GMapLatent. The core of the method is to seamlessly align latent spaces with strict cluster correspondence constraints using the canonical parameterizations of cluster-decorated latent spaces. We first (1) transform the latent space to a canonical parameter domain by composing barycenter translation, optimal transport merging and constrained harmonic mapping, and then (2) compute geometric registration with cluster constraints over the canonical parameter domains. This process realizes a bijective (one-to-one and onto) mapping between newly transformed latent spaces and generates a precise alignment of cluster pairs. Cross-domain generation is then achieved through the aligned latent spaces embedded in the encoder-decoder pipeline. Experiments on gray-scale and color images validate the efficiency, efficacy and applicability of GMapLatent, and demonstrate that the proposed model has superior performance over existing models.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel geometric mapping approach for aligning latent spaces in encoder-decoder architectures, which aligns with the Representation Learning criterion. The focus on foundational methods for latent space alignment is relevant.

## 16. [Quamba2: A Robust and Scalable Post-training Quantization Framework for Selective State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22879) <a id="link16"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.22879

**Authors:** Hung-Yueh Chiang, Chi-Chih Chang, Natalia Frumkin, Kai-Chiang Wu, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Diana Marculescu

**Abstract:** State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms several state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3$\times$ and 3$\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4$\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\%$ average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Quamba.

**Comment:** The paper focuses on quantization for State Space Models (SSMs), which aligns with the model compression criterion, particularly in terms of sparsity and low-bit quantization techniques.

## 17. [Node Embeddings via Neighbor Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23822) <a id="link17"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23822

**Authors:** Jan Niklas B\"ohm, Marius Keute, Alica Guzm\'an, Sebastian Damrich, Andrew Draganov, Dmitry Kobak

**Abstract:** Graph layouts and node embeddings are two distinct paradigms for non-parametric graph representation learning. In the former, nodes are embedded into 2D space for visualization purposes. In the latter, nodes are embedded into a high-dimensional vector space for downstream processing. State-of-the-art algorithms for these two paradigms, force-directed layouts and random-walk-based contrastive learning (such as DeepWalk and node2vec), have little in common. In this work, we show that both paradigms can be approached with a single coherent framework based on established neighbor embedding methods. Specifically, we introduce graph t-SNE, a neighbor embedding method for two-dimensional graph layouts, and graph CNE, a contrastive neighbor embedding method that produces high-dimensional node representations by optimizing the InfoNCE objective. We show that both graph t-SNE and graph CNE strongly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of local structure preservation, while being conceptually simpler.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a unified framework for graph layouts and node embeddings, which aligns with representation learning and proposes a novel neighbor embedding method.

## 18. [RBFleX-NAS: Training-Free Neural Architecture Search Using Radial Basis Function Kernel and Hyperparameter Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22733) <a id="link18"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.22733

**Authors:** Tomomasa Yamasaki, Zhehui Wang, Tao Luo, Niangjun Chen, Bo Wang

**Abstract:** Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an automated technique to design optimal neural network architectures for a specific workload. Conventionally, evaluating candidate networks in NAS involves extensive training, which requires significant time and computational resources. To address this, training-free NAS has been proposed to expedite network evaluation with minimal search time. However, state-of-the-art training-free NAS algorithms struggle to precisely distinguish well-performing networks from poorly-performing networks, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions and consequently sub-optimal top-1 network accuracy. Moreover, they are less effective in activation function exploration. To tackle the challenges, this paper proposes RBFleX-NAS, a novel training-free NAS framework that accounts for both activation outputs and input features of the last layer with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. We also present a detection algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters using the obtained activation outputs and input feature maps. We verify the efficacy of RBFleX-NAS over a variety of NAS benchmarks. RBFleX-NAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art training-free NAS methods in terms of top-1 accuracy, achieving this with short search time in NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-SSS. In addition, it demonstrates higher Kendall correlation compared to layer-based training-free NAS algorithms. Furthermore, we propose NAFBee, a new activation design space that extends the activation type to encompass various commonly used functions. In this extended design space, RBFleX-NAS demonstrates its superiority by accurately identifying the best-performing network during activation function search, providing a significant advantage over other NAS algorithms.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a novel training-free NAS framework (RBFleX-NAS) with significant improvements in architecture search, aligning with the model architecture criterion.

## 19. [Bayesian Predictive Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24016) <a id="link19"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.24016

**Authors:** Alexander Tschantz, Magnus Koudahl, Hampus Linander, Lancelot Da Costa, Conor Heins, Jeff Beck, Christopher Buckley

**Abstract:** Predictive coding (PC) is an influential theory of information processing in the brain, providing a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. It is motivated in terms of Bayesian inference, as hidden states and parameters are optimised via gradient descent on variational free energy. However, implementations of PC rely on maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) estimates of hidden states and maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters, limiting their ability to quantify epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we investigate a Bayesian extension to PC that estimates a posterior distribution over network parameters. This approach, termed Bayesian Predictive coding (BPC), preserves the locality of PC and results in closed-form Hebbian weight updates. Compared to PC, our BPC algorithm converges in fewer epochs in the full-batch setting and remains competitive in the mini-batch setting. Additionally, we demonstrate that BPC offers uncertainty quantification comparable to existing methods in Bayesian deep learning, while also improving convergence properties. Together, these results suggest that BPC provides a biologically plausible method for Bayesian learning in the brain, as well as an attractive approach to uncertainty quantification in deep learning.

**Comment:** The paper introduces Bayesian Predictive Coding, which provides theoretical insights into biologically plausible learning and uncertainty quantification, aligning with foundational research in representation learning.

## 20. [AuditVotes: A Framework Towards More Deployable Certified Robustness for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22998) <a id="link20"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.22998

**Authors:** Yuni Lai, Yulin Zhu, Yixuan Sun, Yulun Wu, Bin Xiao, Gaolei Li, Jianhua Li, Kai Zhou

**Abstract:** Despite advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), adaptive attacks continue to challenge their robustness. Certified robustness based on randomized smoothing has emerged as a promising solution, offering provable guarantees that a model's predictions remain stable under adversarial perturbations within a specified range. However, existing methods face a critical trade-off between accuracy and robustness, as achieving stronger robustness requires introducing greater noise into the input graph. This excessive randomization degrades data quality and disrupts prediction consistency, limiting the practical deployment of certifiably robust GNNs in real-world scenarios where both accuracy and robustness are essential. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{AuditVotes}, the first framework to achieve both high clean accuracy and certifiably robust accuracy for GNNs. It integrates randomized smoothing with two key components, \underline{au}gmentation and con\underline{dit}ional smoothing, aiming to improve data quality and prediction consistency. The augmentation, acting as a pre-processing step, de-noises the randomized graph, significantly improving data quality and clean accuracy. The conditional smoothing, serving as a post-processing step, employs a filtering function to selectively count votes, thereby filtering low-quality predictions and improving voting consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AuditVotes significantly enhances clean accuracy, certified robustness, and empirical robustness while maintaining high computational efficiency. Notably, compared to baseline randomized smoothing, AuditVotes improves clean accuracy by $437.1\%$ and certified accuracy by $409.3\%$ when the attacker can arbitrarily insert $20$ edges on the Cora-ML datasets, representing a substantial step toward deploying certifiably robust GNNs in real-world applications.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a framework for improving the robustness of Graph Neural Networks, which aligns with Model Architecture and Emerging Trends due to its focus on robustness and novel augmentation techniques.

## 21. [Order Independence With Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23483) <a id="link21"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23483

**Authors:** Katrina Brown, Reid McIlroy

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on many NLP tasks, yet often exhibit order dependence: simply reordering semantically identical tokens (e.g., answer choices in multiple-choice questions) can lead to inconsistent predictions. Recent work proposes Set-Based Prompting (SBP) as a way to remove order information from designated token subsets, thereby mitigating positional biases. However, applying SBP on base models induces an out-of-distribution input format, which can degrade in-distribution performance. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy that integrates SBP into the training process, "pulling" these set-formatted prompts closer to the model's training manifold. We show that SBP can be incorporated into a model via fine-tuning. Our experiments on in-distribution (MMLU) and out-of-distribution (CSQA, ARC Challenge) multiple-choice tasks show that SBP fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy and robustness to answer-order permutations, all while preserving broader language modeling capabilities. We discuss the broader implications of order-invariant modeling and outline future directions for building fairer, more consistent LLMs.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a fine-tuning strategy to address order dependence in LLMs, which aligns with foundational research on improving LLM robustness and interpretability.

## 22. [Adaptive Layer-skipping in Pre-trained LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23798) <a id="link22"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23798

**Authors:** Xuan Luo, Weizhi Wang, Xifeng Yan

**Abstract:** Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token generation in large language models (LLMs). However, they have overlooked a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive layer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing FlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32, and meanwhile maintains the full 100\% benchmark performance. Experimental results with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly, this adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance research in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting FlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration.

**Comment:** The paper proposes an adaptive layer-skipping method (FlexiDepth) for LLMs, which aligns with the model architecture criterion by introducing a dynamic mechanism for computational efficiency.

## 23. [How to safely discard features based on aggregate SHAP values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23111) <a id="link23"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23111

**Authors:** Robi Bhattacharjee, Karolin Frohnapfel, Ulrike von Luxburg

**Abstract:** SHAP is one of the most popular local feature-attribution methods. Given a function f and an input x, it quantifies each feature's contribution to f(x). Recently, SHAP has been increasingly used for global insights: practitioners average the absolute SHAP values over many data points to compute global feature importance scores, which are then used to discard unimportant features. In this work, we investigate the soundness of this practice by asking whether small aggregate SHAP values necessarily imply that the corresponding feature does not affect the function. Unfortunately, the answer is no: even if the i-th SHAP value is 0 on the entire data support, there exist functions that clearly depend on Feature i. The issue is that computing SHAP values involves evaluating f on points outside of the data support, where f can be strategically designed to mask its dependence on Feature i. To address this, we propose to aggregate SHAP values over the extended support, which is the product of the marginals of the underlying distribution. With this modification, we show that a small aggregate SHAP value implies that we can safely discard the corresponding feature. We then extend our results to KernelSHAP, the most popular method to approximate SHAP values in practice. We show that if KernelSHAP is computed over the extended distribution, a small aggregate value justifies feature removal. This result holds independently of whether KernelSHAP accurately approximates true SHAP values, making it one of the first theoretical results to characterize the KernelSHAP algorithm itself. Our findings have both theoretical and practical implications. We introduce the Shapley Lie algebra, which offers algebraic insights that may enable a deeper investigation of SHAP and we show that randomly permuting each column of the data matrix enables safely discarding features based on aggregate SHAP and KernelSHAP values.

**Comment:** The paper investigates the soundness of using SHAP values for feature selection and proposes a theoretical framework for safe feature removal, which aligns with 'Model Compression' through feature pruning.

## 24. [An extrapolated and provably convergent algorithm for nonlinear matrix decomposition with the ReLU function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23832) <a id="link24"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23832

**Authors:** Nicolas Gillis, Margherita Porcelli, Giovanni Seraghiti

**Abstract:** Nonlinear matrix decomposition (NMD) with the ReLU function, denoted ReLU-NMD, is the following problem: given a sparse, nonnegative matrix $X$ and a factorization rank $r$, identify a rank-$r$ matrix $\Theta$ such that $X\approx \max(0,\Theta)$. This decomposition finds application in data compression, matrix completion with entries missing not at random, and manifold learning. The standard ReLU-NMD model minimizes the least squares error, that is, $\|X - \max(0,\Theta)\|_F^2$. The corresponding optimization problem is nondifferentiable and highly nonconvex. This motivated Saul to propose an alternative model, Latent-ReLU-NMD, where a latent variable $Z$ is introduced and satisfies $\max(0,Z)=X$ while minimizing $\|Z - \Theta\|_F^2$ (``A nonlinear matrix decomposition for mining the zeros of sparse data'', SIAM J. Math. Data Sci., 2022). Our first contribution is to show that the two formulations may yield different low-rank solutions $\Theta$; in particular, we show that Latent-ReLU-NMD can be ill-posed when ReLU-NMD is not, meaning that there are instances in which the infimum of Latent-ReLU-NMD is not attained while that of ReLU-NMD is. We also consider another alternative model, called 3B-ReLU-NMD, which parameterizes $\Theta=WH$, where $W$ has $r$ columns and $H$ has $r$ rows, allowing one to get rid of the rank constraint in Latent-ReLU-NMD. Our second contribution is to prove the convergence of a block coordinate descent (BCD) applied to 3B-ReLU-NMD and referred to as BCD-NMD. Our third contribution is a novel extrapolated variant of BCD-NMD, dubbed eBCD-NMD, which we prove is also convergent under mild assumptions. We illustrate the significant acceleration effect of eBCD-NMD compared to BCD-NMD, and also show that eBCD-NMD performs well against the state of the art on synthetic and real-world data sets.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel algorithm for nonlinear matrix decomposition with ReLU, which aligns with 'Representation Learning' through its focus on matrix factorization and optimization.

## 25. [Partial Transportability for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23605) <a id="link25"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23605

**Authors:** Kasra Jalaldoust, Alexis Bellot, Elias Bareinboim

**Abstract:** A fundamental task in AI is providing performance guarantees for predictions made in unseen domains. In practice, there can be substantial uncertainty about the distribution of new data, and corresponding variability in the performance of existing predictors. Building on the theory of partial identification and transportability, this paper introduces new results for bounding the value of a functional of the target distribution, such as the generalization error of a classifier, given data from source domains and assumptions about the data generating mechanisms, encoded in causal diagrams. Our contribution is to provide the first general estimation technique for transportability problems, adapting existing parameterization schemes such Neural Causal Models to encode the structural constraints necessary for cross-population inference. We demonstrate the expressiveness and consistency of this procedure and further propose a gradient-based optimization scheme for making scalable inferences in practice. Our results are corroborated with experiments.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel approach to domain generalization using causal diagrams, which is relevant to foundational research in generalization and transportability.

## 26. [On Geometrical Properties of Text Token Embeddings for Strong Semantic Binding in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23011) <a id="link26"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.23011

**Authors:** Hoigi Seo, Junseo Bang, Haechang Lee, Joohoon Lee, Byung Hyun Lee, Se Young Chun

**Abstract:** Text-to-Image (T2I) models often suffer from text-image misalignment in complex scenes involving multiple objects and attributes. Semantic binding aims to mitigate this issue by accurately associating the generated attributes and objects with their corresponding noun phrases (NPs). Existing methods rely on text or latent optimizations, yet the factors influencing semantic binding remain underexplored. Here we investigate the geometrical properties of text token embeddings and their cross-attention (CA) maps. We empirically and theoretically analyze that the geometrical properties of token embeddings, specifically both angular distances and norms, play a crucial role in CA map differentiation. Then, we propose \textbf{TeeMo}, a training-free text embedding-aware T2I framework with strong semantic binding. TeeMo consists of Causality-Aware Projection-Out (CAPO) for distinct inter-NP CA maps and Adaptive Token Mixing (ATM) with our loss to enhance inter-NP separation while maintaining intra-NP cohesion in CA maps. Extensive experiments confirm TeeMo consistently outperforms prior arts across diverse baselines and datasets.

**Comment:** The paper investigates geometrical properties of text token embeddings for text-to-image generation, which aligns with representation learning and architectural analysis.

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.24071

**Authors:** Teresa Dorszewski, Lenka T\v{e}tkov\'a, Robert Jenssen, Lars Kai Hansen, Kristoffer Knutsen Wickstr{\o}m

**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) are increasingly utilized in various computer vision tasks due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, it remains understudied how ViTs process information layer by layer. Numerous studies have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract features of increasing complexity throughout their layers, which is crucial for tasks like domain adaptation and transfer learning. ViTs, lacking the same inductive biases as CNNs, can potentially learn global dependencies from the first layers due to their attention mechanisms. Given the increasing importance of ViTs in computer vision, there is a need to improve the layer-wise understanding of ViTs. In this work, we present a novel, layer-wise analysis of concepts encoded in state-of-the-art ViTs using neuron labeling. Our findings reveal that ViTs encode concepts with increasing complexity throughout the network. Early layers primarily encode basic features such as colors and textures, while later layers represent more specific classes, including objects and animals. As the complexity of encoded concepts increases, the number of concepts represented in each layer also rises, reflecting a more diverse and specific set of features. Additionally, different pretraining strategies influence the quantity and category of encoded concepts, with finetuning to specific downstream tasks generally reducing the number of encoded concepts and shifting the concepts to more relevant categories.

**Comment:** The paper provides a layer-wise analysis of Vision Transformers (ViTs), offering insights into their representation learning dynamics, which aligns with the 'Representation Learning' criterion.

## 28. [Learning Library Cell Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22900) <a id="link28"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2503.22900

**Authors:** Rongjian Liang, Yi-Chen Lu, Wen-Hao Liu, Haoxing Ren

**Abstract:** We propose Lib2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework to efficiently learn meaningful vector representations of library cells, enabling ML models to capture essential cell semantics. The framework comprises three key components: (1) an automated method for generating regularity tests to quantitatively evaluate how well cell representations reflect inter-cell relationships; (2) a self-supervised learning scheme that systematically extracts training data from Liberty files, removing the need for costly labeling; and (3) an attention-based model architecture that accommodates various pin counts and enables the creation of property-specific cell and arc embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that Lib2Vec effectively captures functional and electrical similarities. Moreover, linear algebraic operations on cell vectors reveal meaningful relationships, such as vector(BUF) - vector(INV) + vector(NAND) ~ vector(AND), showcasing the framework's nuanced representation capabilities. Lib2Vec also enhances downstream circuit learning applications, especially when labeled data is scarce.

**Comment:** The paper introduces a self-supervised framework for learning vector representations of library cells, which aligns with Representation Learning. The use of attention-based architecture adds relevance to Model Architecture.
