        "title": "Dataset Distillation with Neural Characteristic Function: A Minmax Perspective",
        "abstract": "Dataset distillation has emerged as a powerful approach for reducing data requirements in deep learning. Among various methods, distribution matching-based approaches stand out for their balance of computational efficiency and strong performance. However, existing distance metrics used in distribution matching often fail to accurately capture distributional differences, leading to unreliable measures of discrepancy. In this paper, we reformulate dataset distillation as a minmax optimization problem and introduce Neural Characteristic Function Discrepancy (NCFD), a comprehensive and theoretically grounded metric for measuring distributional differences. NCFD leverages the Characteristic Function (CF) to encapsulate full distributional information, employing a neural network to optimize the sampling strategy for the CF's frequency arguments, thereby maximizing the discrepancy to enhance distance estimation. Simultaneously, we minimize the difference between real and synthetic data under this optimized NCFD measure. Our approach, termed Neural Characteristic Function Matching (\\mymethod{}), inherently aligns the phase and amplitude of neural features in the complex plane for both real and synthetic data, achieving a balance between realism and diversity in synthetic samples. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on both low- and high-resolution datasets. Notably, we achieve a 20.5\\% accuracy boost on ImageSquawk. Our method also reduces GPU memory usage by over 300$\\times$ and achieves 20$\\times$ faster processing speeds compared to state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve lossless compression of CIFAR-100 on a single NVIDIA 2080 Ti GPU using only 2.3 GB of memory.",

        "abstract": "Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to significantly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly in arithmetic and reasoning tasks, by instructing the model to produce intermediate reasoning steps. Despite the remarkable empirical success of CoT and its theoretical advantages in enhancing expressivity, the mechanisms underlying CoT training remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study the training dynamics of transformers over a CoT objective on an in-context weight prediction task for linear regression. We prove that while a one-layer linear transformer without CoT can only implement a single step of gradient descent (GD) and fails to recover the ground-truth weight vector, a transformer with CoT prompting can learn to perform multi-step GD autoregressively, achieving near-exact recovery. Furthermore, we show that the trained transformer effectively generalizes on the unseen data. With our technique, we also show that looped transformers significantly improve final performance compared to transformers without looping in the in-context learning of linear regression. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoT prompting yields substantial performance improvements.",

In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating effective periodicity modeling can improve the learning efficiency and performance of LLMs. We introduce FANformer, which integrates Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) into attention mechanism to achieve efficient periodicity modeling, by modifying the feature projection process of attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on language modeling show that FANformer consistently outperforms Transformer when scaling up model size and training tokens, underscoring its superior learning efficiency. To further validate the effectiveness of FANformer, we pretrain a FANformer-1B on 1 trillion tokens.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks trained using gradient descent with a fixed learning rate $\\eta$ often operate in the regime of \"edge of stability\" (EOS), where the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian equilibrates about the stability threshold $2/\\eta$. In this work, we present a fine-grained analysis of the learning dynamics of (deep) linear networks (DLNs) within the deep matrix factorization loss beyond EOS. For DLNs, loss oscillations beyond EOS follow a period-doubling route to chaos. We theoretically analyze the regime of the 2-period orbit and show that the loss oscillations occur within a small subspace, with the dimension of the subspace precisely characterized by the learning rate. The crux of our analysis lies in showing that the symmetry-induced conservation law for gradient flow, defined as the balancing gap among the singular values across layers, breaks at EOS and decays monotonically to zero. Overall, our results contribute to explaining two key phenomena in deep networks: (i) shallow models and simple tasks do not always exhibit EOS; and (ii) oscillations occur within top features. We present experiments to support our theory, along with examples demonstrating how these phenomena occur in nonlinear networks and how they differ from those which have benign landscape such as in DLNs.",

We propose a novel interpretation for the learning dynamics of LLMs that vary in both training data and architecture, revealing that three phase transitions commonly emerge across these models during training: (1) alignment with the entire brain surges as LLMs begin adhering to task instructions Brain Alignment and Instruction Following, (2) unexpectedly, LLMs diverge from the brain during a period in which downstream task accuracy temporarily stagnates Brain Detachment and Stagnation, and (3) alignment with the brain reoccurs as LLMs become capable of solving the downstream tasks Brain Realignment and Consolidation.

For instance, when training GPT-2 on the Counterfact dataset, the answers progress from syntactically incorrect to syntactically correct to semantically correct. However, existing theoretical analyses hardly account for this two-stage phenomenon. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate how such two-stage training dynamics occur in transformers. Specifically, we analyze the dynamics of transformers using feature learning techniques under in-context learning regimes, based on a disentangled two-type feature structure. Such disentanglement of feature structure is general in practice, e.g., natural languages contain syntax and semantics, and proteins contain primary and secondary structures. To our best known, this is the first rigorous result regarding a two-stage optimization process in transformers. Additionally, a corollary indicates that such a two-stage process is closely related to the spectral properties of the attention weights, which accords well with empirical findings.",

        "abstract": "Transformers have increasingly become the de facto method to model sequential data with state-of-the-art performance. Due to its widespread use, being able to estimate and calibrate its modeling uncertainty is important to understand and design robust transformer models. To achieve this, previous works have used Gaussian processes (GPs) to perform uncertainty calibration for the attention units of transformers and attained notable successes. However, such approaches have to confine the transformers to the space of symmetric attention to ensure the necessary symmetric requirement of their GP's kernel specification, which reduces the representation capacity of the model. To mitigate this restriction, we propose the Correlated Gaussian Process Transformer (CGPT), a new class of transformers whose self-attention units are modeled as cross-covariance between two correlated GPs (CGPs). This allows asymmetries in attention and can enhance the representation capacity of GP-based transformers. We also derive a sparse approximation for CGP to make it scale better. Our empirical studies show that both CGP-based and sparse CGP-based transformers achieve better performance than state-of-the-art GP-based transformers on a variety of benchmark tasks.

        "abstract": "Pre-training Transformers in FP4 precision is becoming a promising approach to gain substantial speedup, but it comes with a considerable loss of accuracy. Microscaling (MX) data format provides a fine-grained per-group quantization method to improve the representation ability of the FP4 format and is supported by the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture. However, training with MXFP4 data format still results in significant degradation and there is a lack of systematic research on the reason.   In this work, we propose a novel training method TetraJet for a more accurate FP4 training. We comprehensively evaluate all of the quantizers involved in the training, and identify the weight oscillation problem in the forward pass as the main source of the degradation in MXFP4 training. Therefore, we introduce two novel methods, EMA Quantizer (Q-EMA) and Adaptive Ramping Optimizer (Q-Ramping), to resolve the oscillation problem. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers demonstrate that TetraJet consistently outperforms the existing 4-bit training methods, and Q-EMA & Q-Ramping can provide additional enhancement by effectively reducing oscillation. We decreased the accuracy degradation by more than $50\\%$ compared to the baseline, and can even achieve competitive performance compared to full precision training.

In order to understand these phenomena, we study the training dynamics of large two-layer neural networks.

This characterization applies to a Gaussian approximation of the hidden neurons non-linearity, and empirically captures well the behavior of actual neural network models.   Our analysis uncovers several interesting new phenomena in the training dynamics: $(i)$ The emergence of a slow time scale associated with the growth in Gaussian/Rademacher complexity; $(ii)$ As a consequence, algorithmic inductive bias towards small complexity, but only if the initialization has small enough complexity; $(iii)$ A separation of time scales between feature learning and overfitting; $(iv)$ A non-monotone behavior of the test error and, correspondingly, a `feature unlearning' phase at large times.",

We provide theoretical analyses of implicit regularization and convergence under the Adam optimizer when SR is utilized.

Empirical results from pre-training models with up to 6.7B parameters, for the first time, demonstrate that our BF16 with SR strategy outperforms (BF16, FP32) mixed precision strategies, achieving better validation perplexity, up to $1.54\\times$ higher throughput, and $30\\%$ less memory usage.",

Although existing studies have attempted to explain LLM functionalities by identifying and interpreting specific neurons, these efforts mostly focus on individual neuron contributions, neglecting the fact that human brain functions are realized through intricate interaction networks. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience research on functional brain networks (FBNs), this study introduces a novel approach to investigate whether similar functional networks exist within LLMs. We use methods similar to those in the field of functional neuroimaging analysis to locate and identify functional networks in LLM. Experimental results show that, similar to the human brain, LLMs contain functional networks that frequently recur during operation. Further analysis shows that these functional networks are crucial for LLM performance. Masking key functional networks significantly impairs the model's performance, while retaining just a subset of these networks is adequate to maintain effective operation. This research provides novel insights into the interpretation of LLMs and the lightweighting of LLMs for certain downstream tasks.

Despite their advantages, training SNNs with traditional backpropagation (BP) remains challenging due to computational inefficiencies and a lack of biological plausibility. This study explores the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm as an alternative learning framework for SNNs. Unlike backpropagation, which relies on forward and backward passes, the FF algorithm employs two forward passes, enabling localized learning, enhanced computational efficiency, and improved compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. We introduce an FF-based SNN training framework and evaluate its performance across both non-spiking (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10) and spiking (Neuro-MNIST, SHD) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing FF-based SNNs by over 5% on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST while achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art backpropagation-trained SNNs. On more complex tasks such as CIFAR-10 and SHD, our approach outperforms other SNN models by up to 6% and remains competitive with leading backpropagation-trained SNNs. These findings highlight the FF algorithm's potential to advance SNN training methodologies and neuromorphic computing by addressing key limitations of backpropagation.",

Such source-free setting comes with the risk of catastrophic forgetting, hence, ii) we propose center vector regularization (CVR), a set of auxiliary operations that minimize catastrophic forgetting and additionally reduces the computational cost by skipping backpropagation in 50\\% of the training iterations. Finally iii) we perform this adaptation process in a parameter-efficient way by adapting the pretrained model through low-rank adaptation methods, resulting in a fraction of parameters to optimize.

However, current SAE methods are limited by optimizing both reconstruction quality and sparsity simultaneously, as they rely on either activation suppression or rigid sparsity constraints. To this end, we introduce Matryoshka SAE (MSAE), a new architecture that learns hierarchical representations at multiple granularities simultaneously, enabling a direct optimization of both metrics without compromise. MSAE establishes a new state-of-the-art Pareto frontier between reconstruction quality and sparsity for CLIP, achieving 0.99 cosine similarity and less than 0.1 fraction of variance unexplained while maintaining ~80% sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of MSAE as a tool for interpreting and controlling CLIP by extracting over 120 semantic concepts from its representation to perform concept-based similarity search and bias analysis in downstream tasks like CelebA.",

Several studies have evaluated the possibility to promote SG through the proposal of novel architectures, loss functions or training methodologies. Few studies, however, have focused on the role of training data properties in promoting SG. In this work, we investigate the impact of certain data distributional properties, as inductive biases for the SG ability of a multi-modal language model. To this end, we study three different properties. First, data diversity, instantiated as an increase in the possible values a latent property in the training distribution may take. Second, burstiness, where we probabilistically restrict the number of possible values of latent factors on particular inputs during training. Third, latent intervention, where a particular latent factor is altered randomly during training. We find that all three factors significantly enhance SG, with diversity contributing an 89\\% absolute increase in accuracy in the most affected property. Through a series of experiments, we test various hypotheses to understand why these properties promote SG. Finally, we find that Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between latent attributes in the training distribution is strongly predictive of out-of-distribution generalization. We find that a mechanism by which lower NMI induces SG is in the geometry of representations. In particular, we find that NMI induces more parallelism in neural representations (i.e., input features coded in parallel neural vectors) of the model, a property related to the capacity of reasoning by analogy.",

To address this issue, we introduce GloFND, an optimization-based approach that automatically learns on the fly the threshold for each anchor data to identify its false negatives during training.

How are these two subtasks implemented and integrated internally? Across multiple datasets and models, we identify a promote-then-suppress mechanism: the model first recalls all answers, and then suppresses previously generated ones. Specifically, LMs use both the subject and previous answer tokens to perform knowledge recall, with attention propagating subject information and MLPs promoting the answers. Then, attention attends to and suppresses previous answer tokens, while MLPs amplify the suppression signal. Our mechanism is corroborated by extensive experimental evidence: in addition to using early decoding and causal tracing, we analyze how components use different tokens by introducing both \\emph{Token Lens}, which decodes aggregated attention updates from specified tokens, and a knockout method that analyzes changes in MLP outputs after removing attention to specified tokens. Overall, we provide new insights into how LMs' internal components interact with different input tokens to support complex factual recall.

ACID can be trained on synthetic data in a supervised learning fashion, and the learned model can then be applied to any dataset of similar natures or adapted to new domains by fine-tuning with a negligible computational cost. Our extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real data reveal that ACID consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance against existing baselines under multiple metrics, and is able to generalize robustly to unseen sample sizes, dimensionalities, as well as non-linearities with a remarkably low inference time.",

Previous efforts to mitigate these challenges have relied on fixed sparse attention patterns or identifying sparse attention patterns based on limited cases.

In this paper, we introduce FlexPrefill, a Flexible sparse Pre-filling mechanism that dynamically adjusts sparse attention patterns and computational budget in real-time to meet the specific requirements of each input and attention head. The flexibility of our method is demonstrated through two key innovations: 1) Query-Aware Sparse Pattern Determination: By measuring Jensen-Shannon divergence, this component adaptively switches between query-specific diverse attention patterns and predefined attention patterns. 2) Cumulative-Attention Based Index Selection: This component dynamically selects query-key indexes to be computed based on different attention patterns, ensuring the sum of attention scores meets a predefined threshold. FlexPrefill adaptively optimizes the sparse pattern and sparse ratio of each attention head based on the prompt, enhancing efficiency in long-sequence inference tasks. Experimental results show significant improvements in both speed and accuracy over prior methods, providing a more flexible and efficient solution for LLM inference.",

It accomplishes this by transferring knowledge from well-established source domains to a less familiar target domain. However, traditional transfer learning methods often face difficulties due to rigid model assumptions and the need for a high degree of similarity between source and target domain models. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for transfer learning called Transfer learning through Enhanced Sufficient Representation (TESR). Our approach begins by estimating a sufficient and invariant representation from the source domains. This representation is then enhanced with an independent component derived from the target data, ensuring that it is sufficient for the target domain and adaptable to its specific characteristics. A notable advantage of TESR is that it does not rely on assuming similar model structures across different tasks. For example, the source domain models can be regression models, while the target domain task can be classification. This flexibility makes TESR applicable to a wide range of supervised learning problems. We explore the theoretical properties of TESR and validate its performance through simulation studies and real-world data applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in finite sample settings.",

        "title": "ByteScale: Efficient Scaling of LLM Training with a 2048K Context Length on More Than 12,000 GPUs",
        "abstract": "Scaling long-context ability is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs). To amortize the memory consumption across multiple devices in long-context training, inter-data partitioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data partitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training frameworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish static communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a 2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no matter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch between data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and imbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.   In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable LLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short sequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid Data Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning with a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer, which eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware sharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication cost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a balance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware data assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to 141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more than 12,000 GPUs. Experiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the state-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89x.",

        "abstract": "Speculative Decoding (SD) enforces strict distributional equivalence to the target model, limiting potential speed ups as distributions of near-equivalence achieve comparable outcomes in many cases. Furthermore, enforcing distributional equivalence means that users are unable to trade deviations from the target model distribution for further inference speed gains. To address these limitations, we introduce Fuzzy Speculative Decoding (FSD) - a decoding algorithm that generalizes SD by accepting candidate tokens purely based on the divergences between the target and draft model distributions. By allowing for controlled divergence from the target model, FSD enables users to flexibly trade generation quality for inference speed. Across several benchmarks, our method is able to achieve significant runtime improvements of over 5 tokens per second faster than SD at only an approximate 2% absolute reduction in benchmark accuracy. In many cases, FSD is even able to match SD benchmark accuracy at over 2 tokens per second faster, demonstrating that distributional equivalence is not necessary to maintain target model performance.",
