        "title": "SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning",
        "abstract": "Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

        "title": "Reliable Unlearning Harmful Information in LLMs with Metamorphosis Representation Projection",
        "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques, such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural performance.

        "abstract": "In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged, achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters, continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic stabilities for crystals.

        "abstract": "Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers (ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs, derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap, where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ), a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.",

Consequently, existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space, but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.   We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii) partitioning \"conflicts\" that require resolution.   Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even for complex and large models.",

Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability. Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems. Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute.

Existing unlearning methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of datasets verify the efficacy of our method.",

This survey presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.",

In this work, we propose \\textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens. Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density, allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods. Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103 and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\\times$ reduction in token count and $1.9\\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large language models.",

        "abstract": "Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%), demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand modeling.",

PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design, allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects.

We highlight connections between PIN and established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural networks.

        "abstract": "Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications. Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas, improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery, and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However, existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies, resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias, EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends, effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and temporal biases.",

        "abstract": "The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.",

To fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal changes than existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id (db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.",

        "abstract": "Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However, they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters, thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current state-of-the-art models.",
