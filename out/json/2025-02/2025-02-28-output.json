        "abstract": "We study the statistical-computational trade-offs for learning with exact invariances (or symmetries) using kernel regression. Traditional methods, such as data augmentation, group averaging, canonicalization, and frame-averaging, either fail to provide a polynomial-time solution or are not applicable in the kernel setting. However, with oracle access to the geometric properties of the input space, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm that learns a classifier with \\emph{exact} invariances. Moreover, our approach achieves the same excess population risk (or generalization error) as the original kernel regression problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time algorithm to achieve exact (not approximate) invariances in this context. Our proof leverages tools from differential geometry, spectral theory, and optimization. A key result in our development is a new reformulation of the problem of learning under invariances as optimizing an infinite number of linearly constrained convex quadratic programs, which may be of independent interest.",

In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.",

Task Arithmetic (TA), which combines task vectors derived from fine-tuning, enables multi-task learning and task forgetting but struggles to isolate task-specific knowledge from general instruction-following behavior. To address this, we propose Layer-Aware Task Arithmetic (LATA), a novel approach that assigns layer-specific weights to task vectors based on their alignment with instruction-following or task-specific components. By amplifying task-relevant layers and attenuating instruction-following layers, LATA improves task learning and forgetting performance while preserving overall model utility. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including WikiText-2, GSM8K, and HumanEval, demonstrate that LATA outperforms existing methods in both multi-task learning and selective task forgetting, achieving higher task accuracy and alignment with minimal degradation in output quality. Our findings highlight the importance of layer-wise analysis in disentangling task-specific and general-purpose knowledge, offering a robust framework for efficient model merging and editing.",

The development of large MoE models in the distributed scenario encounters the problem of large communication overhead. The inter-device communication of a MoE layer can occupy 47% time of the entire model execution with popular models and frameworks. Therefore, existing methods suggest the communication in a MoE layer to be pipelined with the computation for overlapping. However, these coarse grained overlapping schemes introduce a notable impairment of computational efficiency and the latency concealing is sub-optimal.   To this end, we present COMET, an optimized MoE system with fine-grained communication-computation overlapping. Leveraging data dependency analysis and task rescheduling, COMET achieves precise fine-grained overlapping of communication and computation. Through adaptive workload assignment, COMET effectively eliminates fine-grained communication bottlenecks and enhances its adaptability across various scenarios. Our evaluation shows that COMET accelerates the execution of a single MoE layer by $1.96\\times$ and for end-to-end execution, COMET delivers a $1.71\\times$ speedup on average. COMET has been adopted in the production environment of clusters with ten-thousand-scale of GPUs, achieving savings of millions of GPU hours.",

Existing PEFT methods often lack robustness and fail to generalize effectively across diverse tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address this, we present a new highly computationally efficient framework called AdaZo-SAM, combining Adam and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) while requiring only a single-gradient computation in every iteration. This is achieved using a stochastic zeroth-order estimation to find SAM's ascent perturbation. We provide a convergence guarantee for AdaZo-SAM and show that it improves the generalization ability of state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Additionally, we design a low-rank gradient optimization method named LORENZA, which is a memory-efficient version of AdaZo-SAM. LORENZA utilizes a randomized SVD scheme to efficiently compute the subspace projection matrix and apply optimization steps onto the selected subspace. This technique enables full-parameter fine-tuning with adaptive low-rank gradient updates, achieving the same reduced memory consumption as gradient-low-rank-projection methods. We provide a convergence analysis of LORENZA and demonstrate its merits for pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs.",

To shed light on these issues, we perform a comprehensive study of the internal mechanisms that support abstract rule induction in an open-source language model (Llama3-70B). We identify an emergent symbolic architecture that implements abstract reasoning via a series of three computations. In early layers, symbol abstraction heads convert input tokens to abstract variables based on the relations between those tokens. In intermediate layers, symbolic induction heads perform sequence induction over these abstract variables. Finally, in later layers, retrieval heads predict the next token by retrieving the value associated with the predicted abstract variable. These results point toward a resolution of the longstanding debate between symbolic and neural network approaches, suggesting that emergent reasoning in neural networks depends on the emergence of symbolic mechanisms.",

However, in real life, human learning does not follow any of these techniques exclusively. The way a human learns is basically a combination of forward learning, backward propagation and cooperation. Humans start learning a new concept by themselves and try to refine their understanding hierarchically during which they might come across several doubts. The most common approach to doubt solving is a discussion with peers, which can be called cooperation. Cooperation/discussion/knowledge sharing among peers is one of the most important steps of learning that humans follow. However, there might still be a few doubts even after the discussion. Then the difference between the understanding of the concept and the original literature is identified and minimized over several revisions. Inspired by this, the paper introduces Forward-Cooperation-Backward (FCB) learning in a deep neural network framework mimicking the human nature of learning a new concept. A novel deep neural network architecture, called Multi Encoding Uni Decoding neural network model, has been designed which learns using the notion of FCB. A special lateral synaptic connection has also been introduced to realize cooperation. The models have been justified in terms of their performance in dimension reduction on four popular datasets. The ability to preserve the granular properties of data in low-rank embedding has been tested to justify the quality of dimension reduction. For downstream analyses, classification has also been performed. An experimental study on convergence analysis has been performed to establish the efficacy of the FCB learning strategy.",

To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.",

To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

This weakness has been recently mitigated by replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel and efficient method \"Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample.

        "abstract": "The analytic characterization of the high-dimensional behavior of optimization for Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with Gaussian data has been a central focus in statistics and probability in recent years. While convex cases, such as the LASSO, ridge regression, and logistic regression, have been extensively studied using a variety of techniques, the non-convex case remains far less understood despite its significance. A non-rigorous statistical physics framework has provided remarkable predictions for the behavior of high-dimensional optimization problems, but rigorously establishing their validity for non-convex problems has remained a fundamental challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by developing a systematic framework that rigorously proves replica-symmetric formulas for non-convex GLMs and precisely determines the conditions under which these formulas are valid. Remarkably, the rigorous replica-symmetric predictions align exactly with the conjectures made by physicists, and the so-called replicon condition. The originality of our approach lies in connecting two powerful theoretical tools: the Gaussian Min-Max Theorem, which we use to provide precise lower bounds, and Approximate Message Passing (AMP), which is shown to achieve these bounds algorithmically. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through significant applications: (i) by proving the optimality of the Tukey loss over the more commonly used Huber loss under a $\\varepsilon$ contaminated data model, (ii) establishing the optimality of negative regularization in high-dimensional non-convex regression and (iii) characterizing the performance limits of linearized AMP algorithms. By rigorously validating statistical physics predictions in non-convex settings, we aim to open new pathways for analyzing increasingly complex optimization landscapes beyond the convex regime.",

To that end, we build on the Topological Autoencoders (TopoAE) formulation. First, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of its associated loss and show that a zero loss indeed induces identical persistence pairs (in high and low dimensions) for the $0$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^0$) of the Rips filtration. We also provide a counter example showing that this property no longer holds for a naive extension of TopoAE to PH$^d$ for $d\\ge 1$. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel generalization of TopoAE to $1$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^1$), called TopoAE++, for the accurate generation of cycle-aware planar embeddings, addressing the above failure case. This generalization is based on the notion of cascade distortion, a new penalty term favoring an isometric embedding of the $2$-chains filling persistent $1$-cycles, hence resulting in more faithful geometrical reconstructions of the $1$-cycles in the plane. We further introduce a novel, fast algorithm for the exact computation of PH for Rips filtrations in the plane, yielding improved runtimes over previously documented topology-aware methods. Our method also achieves a better balance between the topological accuracy, as measured by the Wasserstein distance, and the visual preservation of the cycles in low dimensions.

In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single GPU. These advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications that involve very long and highly volatile data.",

        "abstract": "The goal of causal discovery is to learn a directed acyclic graph from data. One of the most well-known methods for this problem is Greedy Equivalence Search (GES). GES searches for the graph by incrementally and greedily adding or removing edges to maximize a model selection criterion. It has strong theoretical guarantees on infinite data but can fail in practice on finite data. In this paper, we first identify some of the causes of GES's failure, finding that it can get blocked in local optima, especially in denser graphs. We then propose eXtremely Greedy Equivalent Search (XGES), which involves a new heuristic to improve the search strategy of GES while retaining its theoretical guarantees. In particular, XGES favors deleting edges early in the search over inserting edges, which reduces the possibility of the search ending in local optima. A further contribution of this work is an efficient algorithmic formulation of XGES (and GES). We benchmark XGES on simulated datasets with known ground truth. We find that XGES consistently outperforms GES in recovering the correct graphs, and it is 10 times faster. XGES implementations in Python and C++ are available at https://github.com/ANazaret/XGES.",

        "abstract": "Most techniques for explainable machine learning focus on feature attribution, i.e., values are assigned to the features such that their sum equals the prediction. Example attribution is another form of explanation that assigns weights to the training examples, such that their scalar product with the labels equals the prediction. The latter may provide valuable complementary information to feature attribution, in particular in cases where the features are not easily interpretable. Current example-based explanation techniques have targeted a few model types only, such as k-nearest neighbors and random forests. In this work, a technique for obtaining example-based explanations from deep neural networks (EBE-DNN) is proposed. The basic idea is to use the deep neural network to obtain an embedding, which is employed by a k-nearest neighbor classifier to form a prediction; the example attribution can hence straightforwardly be derived from the latter. Results from an empirical investigation show that EBE-DNN can provide highly concentrated example attributions, i.e., the predictions can be explained with few training examples, without reducing accuracy compared to the original deep neural network. Another important finding from the empirical investigation is that the choice of layer to use for the embeddings may have a large impact on the resulting accuracy.",

A common approach to addressing the variation is to average a ranking function output over several evaluations. We propose taking into account the variation in a different manner, by viewing the ranking function output as a random variable representing a proxy performance metric. During the search process, we strive to construct a stochastic ordering of the performance metrics to determine the best architecture.

        "abstract": "Message passing-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many real-world applications. For a sampled mini-batch of target nodes, the message passing process is divided into two parts: message passing between nodes within the batch (MP-IB) and message passing from nodes outside the batch to those within it (MP-OB). However, MP-OB recursively relies on higher-order out-of-batch neighbors, leading to an exponentially growing computational cost with respect to the number of layers. Due to the neighbor explosion, the whole message passing stores most nodes and edges on the GPU such that many GNNs are infeasible to large-scale graphs. To address this challenge, we propose an accurate and fast mini-batch approach for large graph transductive learning, namely topological compensation (TOP), which obtains the outputs of the whole message passing solely through MP-IB, without the costly MP-OB. The major pillar of TOP is a novel concept of message invariance, which defines message-invariant transformations to convert costly MP-OB into fast MP-IB. This ensures that the modified MP-IB has the same output as the whole message passing. Experiments demonstrate that TOP is significantly faster than existing mini-batch methods by order of magnitude on vast graphs (millions of nodes and billions of edges) with limited accuracy degradation.",

The system consists of a controlled optical experiment specifically built for this purpose, which satisfies the core assumptions of CRL and where the underlying causal factors (the inputs to the experiment) are known, providing a ground truth. We select methods representative of different approaches to CRL and find that they all fail to recover the underlying causal factors. To understand the failure modes of the evaluated algorithms, we perform an ablation on the data by substituting the real data-generating process with a simpler synthetic equivalent. The results reveal a reproducibility problem, as most methods already fail on this synthetic ablation despite its simple data-generating process. Additionally, we observe that common assumptions on the mixing function are crucial for the performance of some of the methods but do not hold in the real data. Our efforts highlight the contrast between the theoretical promise of the state of the art and the challenges in its application. We hope the benchmark serves as a simple, real-world sanity check to further develop and validate methodology, bridging the gap towards CRL methods that work in practice.

But what those networks can learn depends upon their inductive biases -- the factors other than the data that influence the solutions they discover -- and the inductive biases of neural networks remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to draw conclusions about human learning from the performance of these systems. Cognitive scientists and machine learning researchers often focus on the architecture of a neural network as a source of inductive bias. In this paper we explore the impact of another source of inductive bias -- the initial weights of the network -- using meta-learning as a tool for finding initial weights that are adapted for specific problems. We evaluate four widely-used architectures -- MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers -- by meta-training 430 different models across three tasks requiring different biases and forms of generalization. We find that meta-learning can substantially reduce or entirely eliminate performance differences across architectures and data representations, suggesting that these factors may be less important as sources of inductive bias than is typically assumed. When differences are present, architectures and data representations that perform well without meta-learning tend to meta-train more effectively. Moreover, all architectures generalize poorly on problems that are far from their meta-training experience, underscoring the need for stronger inductive biases for robust generalization.",

We assume that comparisons stem from latent user and item features, which reduces the task of predicting preferences to learning these features from comparison data. Similar to the classical matrix factorization problem, the main challenge in this learning task is that the resulting loss function is nonconvex. Our analysis shows that the loss function exhibits (restricted) strong convexity near the true solution, which ensures gradient-based methods converge exponentially, given an appropriate warm start. Importantly, this result holds in a sparse data regime, where each user compares only a few pairs of items. Our main technical contribution is to extend certain concentration inequalities commonly used in matrix completion to our model.

        "abstract": "Data and pipeline parallelism are ubiquitous for training of Large Language Models (LLM) on distributed nodes. Driven by the need for cost-effective training, recent work explores efficient communication arrangement for end to end training. Motivated by LLM's resistance to layer skipping and layer reordering, in this paper, we explore stage (several consecutive layers) skipping in pipeline training, and challenge the conventional practice of sequential pipeline execution. We derive convergence and throughput constraints (guidelines) for pipelining with skipping and swapping pipeline stages. Based on these constraints, we propose SkipPipe, the first partial pipeline framework to reduce the end-to-end training time for LLMs while preserving the convergence. The core of SkipPipe is a path scheduling algorithm that optimizes the paths for individual microbatches and reduces idle time (due to microbatch collisions) on the distributed nodes, complying with the given stage skipping ratio. We extensively evaluate SkipPipe on LLaMa models from 500M to 8B parameters on up to 20 nodes. Our results show that SkipPipe reduces training iteration time by up to $55\\%$ compared to full pipeline. Our partial pipeline training also improves resistance to layer omission during inference, experiencing a drop in perplexity of only $7\\%$ when running only half the model. Our code is available at https://github.com/gensyn-ai/skippipe.",

However, this approach introduces a trade-off between computation and performance: while SSL helps with representation learning, it requires a separate, often time-consuming training phase, increasing computational overhead and limiting efficiency in resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose MixTraining, a novel framework that interleaves several SSL and SL epochs within a unified mixtraining training phase, featuring a smooth transition between two learning objectives. MixTraining enhances synergy between SSL and SL for improved accuracy and consolidates shared computation steps to reduce computation overhead. MixTraining is versatile and applicable to both single-task and multi-task learning scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixTraining offers a superior compute-performance trade-off compared to conventional pipelines, achieving an 8.81% absolute accuracy gain (18.89% relative accuracy gain) on the TinyImageNet dataset while accelerating training by up to 1.29x   with the ViT-Tiny model.",

This integrated approach allows a single model to independently guide its reasoning process, offering computational advantages for model deployment. We particularly focus on the representative task of self-correction, where models autonomously detect errors in their responses, revise outputs, and decide when to terminate iterative refinement loops. To enable this, we propose a two-staged algorithmic framework for constructing self-rewarding reasoning models using only self-generated data. In the first stage, we employ sequential rejection sampling to synthesize long chain-of-thought trajectories that incorporate both self-rewarding and self-correction mechanisms. Fine-tuning models on these curated data allows them to learn the patterns of self-rewarding and self-correction. In the second stage, we further enhance the models' ability to assess response accuracy and refine outputs through reinforcement learning with rule-based signals. Experiments with Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 demonstrate that our approach surpasses intrinsic self-correction capabilities and achieves performance comparable to systems that rely on external reward models.",

        "abstract": "We study beyond worst-case dimensionality reduction for $s$-sparse vectors. Our work is divided into two parts, each focusing on a different facet of beyond worst-case analysis:   We first consider average-case guarantees. A folklore upper bound based on the birthday-paradox states: For any collection $X$ of $s$-sparse vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a linear map to $\\mathbb{R}^{O(s^2)}$ which \\emph{exactly} preserves the norm of $99\\%$ of the vectors in $X$ in any $\\ell_p$ norm (as opposed to the usual setting where guarantees hold for all vectors). We give lower bounds showing that this is indeed optimal in many settings: any oblivious linear map satisfying similar average-case guarantees must map to $\\Omega(s^2)$ dimensions. The same lower bound also holds for a wide class of smooth maps, including `encoder-decoder schemes', where we compare the norm of the original vector to that of a smooth function of the embedding. These lower bounds reveal a separation result, as an upper bound of $O(s \\log(d))$ is possible if we instead use arbitrary (possibly non-smooth) functions, e.g., via compressed sensing algorithms.   Given these lower bounds, we specialize to sparse \\emph{non-negative} vectors. For a dataset $X$ of non-negative $s$-sparse vectors and any $p \\ge 1$, we can non-linearly embed $X$ to $O(s\\log(|X|s)/\\epsilon^2)$ dimensions while preserving all pairwise distances in $\\ell_p$ norm up to $1\\pm \\epsilon$, with no dependence on $p$. Surprisingly, the non-negativity assumption enables much smaller embeddings than arbitrary sparse vectors, where the best known bounds suffer exponential dependence. Our map also guarantees \\emph{exact} dimensionality reduction for $\\ell_{\\infty}$ by embedding into $O(s\\log |X|)$ dimensions, which is tight. We show that both the non-linearity of $f$ and the non-negativity of $X$ are necessary, and provide downstream algorithmic improvements.",

        "abstract": "Concept-based methods have emerged as a promising direction to develop interpretable neural networks in standard supervised settings. However, most works that study them in incremental settings assume either a static concept set across all experiences or assume that each experience relies on a distinct set of concepts. In this work, we study concept-based models in a more realistic, dynamic setting where new classes may rely on older concepts in addition to introducing new concepts themselves. We show that concepts and classes form a complex web of relationships, which is susceptible to degradation and needs to be preserved and augmented across experiences. We introduce new metrics to show that existing concept-based models cannot preserve these relationships even when trained using methods to prevent catastrophic forgetting, since they cannot handle forgetting at concept, class, and concept-class relationship levels simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose a novel method - MuCIL - that uses multimodal concepts to perform classification without increasing the number of trainable parameters across experiences. The multimodal concepts are aligned to concepts provided in natural language, making them interpretable by design. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art classification performance compared to other concept-based models, achieving over 2$\\times$ the classification performance in some cases. We also study the ability of our model to perform interventions on concepts, and show that it can localize visual concepts in input images, providing post-hoc interpretations.",

However, this approach neglects the potential to distill both data (output content) and reward signals (quality evaluations). Extracting reliable reward signals directly from teacher models is challenging, as LLMs are optimized for generation rather than evaluation, often resulting in biased or inconsistent assessments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel distillation pipeline that transfers both responses and rewards. Our method generates pseudo-rewards through a self-supervised mechanism that leverages the inherent structure of both teacher and student responses, enabling reward learning without explicit external evaluation. The reward model subsequently guides reinforcement learning (RL), allowing iterative refinement of the student model after an SFT warm-up phase. Experiments on GSM8K and MMLU-PRO demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional SFT-based approaches, enabling student models to surpass the performance of their teachers. This work highlights the potential for scalable, efficient distillation through structured self-supervised reward learning, reducing dependence on external reward supervision.",

We reframe self-consistency as a dynamic distributional alignment problem, revealing that decoding temperature not only governs sampling randomness but also actively shapes the latent answer distribution. Given that high temperatures require prohibitively large sample sizes to stabilize, while low temperatures risk amplifying biases, we propose a confidence-driven mechanism that dynamically calibrates temperature: sharpening the sampling distribution under uncertainty to align with high-probability modes, and promoting exploration when confidence is high. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show this approach outperforms fixed-diversity baselines under limited samples, improving both average and best-case performance across varying initial temperatures without additional data or modules.
